      "                answer to the Doctor, as to this particular. They say, those of the Congregational way in England, plead for Anabaptists liberty as for their own. That they plead for liberty and indulgence to be extended towards those that differ from them only in that point of Paedo-Baptisme, I believe: when I was in England, I did so my self; and if I were their now, I would do so again: but that they should plead for liberty unto such practices, as our Anabaptists have been guilty of, is not easie to believe; or, if they do, it is because such Narrators as these Animadverted upon, have by untrue Relations misguided them into undue Apprehensions. Nay, I am fully convinced, that those of their own way, if of serious and gracious Spirits, when once they are possessed with a true Relation of things concerning them, will see cause to condemn New-England less, and those their Friends more, than at first they were aware of: How did they bear the World in hand, that the Churches here did Excommunicate them for nothing but their Opinion, in scrupling Paedobaptisme! But that therein they have dealt most untruely, and injuriously; the subsequent Answer to their Narrative hath made apparent from the Church-Records concerning those matters.\n",
      "            Finally, let me intreat the Brethren to believe, that some of us would shew as much indulgence unto truly tender Consciences, as themselves. It is not so long since our own Necks bled under an intolerable yoke of Imposition upon Conscience, as that we should forget what it is to be so dealt with; or exercise that severity towards any, that we have our selves complained of, in others. But the Brethren will readily own that some men have pretended Conscience, when pride, & perverseness in the will, have been at the bottom: They will also confess, that a meer pretence of Conscience, is not enough to bear men out in an evil practice. All the difficulty is, in discerning the one of these from the other. Blessed Mr. Burroughs in his excellent Irenicum, hath laid down Rules concerning this: And if that which he saith, pag. 32. be sound Doctrine (as undoubtedly it is) some of our Anabaptists, have not such characters of a tender Conscience upon them, as were to be desired.

      " ne sutor ultra crepidam. or brief animadversions upon the new-england anabaptists late fallacious narrative wherein the notorious mistakes and falshoods by them published are detected. by samuel willard teacher of a church in boston in new-england. prov. 18. 17. he that is first in his own cause seemeth just but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. rom. 16. 17. now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them. 18. for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their 〈…〉  and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. boston in new-england printed by s. green upon assignment of s. sewall. and are to be sold by 〈◊〉 philips at the west end of the exchange 1681. to the reader. the anabaptists in new-england have in their narrative lately published endeavoured to make candida de 〈◊〉  de 〈…〉  themselves the innocent person and the lords servants 〈◊〉 no better than persecutors. in which respect it hath been 〈◊〉 necessary that some one should 〈◊〉 upon what they 〈◊〉 done that so such persons as have been 〈…〉 by their untrue relation may be disabused. many are of the 〈◊〉 it is not worth the while to take notice of what 〈◊〉 by men so obscure and inconsiderable. and i 〈◊〉 i have though 〈◊〉 self so far as i am personally concerned in any of their reflections 〈…〉 shall 〈◊〉 lose precious time in a needless desence. 〈…〉  furore ego 〈◊〉 contemptu  vincit 〈…〉  in christ. it seems to me that the reverend author of the following 〈…〉 versions hath shewed much humility in condescending to take persons in hand between whom and himself there is such an impar congressus and let it be that for this once. he hath contradicted that proverbial saying aquils non capit muse as had he not been sensible that by good words and fair speeches the hearts of the 〈◊〉 are deceived this pains would have been spared. i verily believe that the 〈◊〉 baptists by their fallacious narrative have grievously offended god 〈…〉 the things by them misrepresented were not done a far off for then mistakes about them would have been excusable but at home where right information was easie to have been obtained had they been willing to have 〈…〉 others should have known the truth. and by this means have they done ill 〈◊〉 themselves forcing others to discover the enormities of some whose 〈…〉 and shame should not have been divulged to the world and to posterity forever but slept in a grave of silence had not their own narrative brought them forth. they have also by letters misrepresented worthy and honourable persons as well as things and their reports have been received elsewhere with too much readiness and credulity as i perceive by certain complainants whosay they understand that the present honourable governour of this colony had threatned this poor people their christian friends as they stile them with death which 〈◊〉 report of theirs is like too many particulars in their vindication an utter 〈◊〉 quil 〈…〉 . the governour whose integrity wisdome and 〈…〉 is well known hath sometimes moved that an old severe law made against those that should manifest any publick contempt of that ordinance of infant 〈◊〉 might be lenifyed. so far is the scandalous report which they have raised upon the governour and caused it to fly three thousand miles from being true. as for the brethren that have thought good to prefix an epistle to such a narrative and there 〈◊〉 declare that molestation is given and severity is exercised towards 〈…〉 england meerly for a supposed error about the subject of 〈…〉  and holy men they are marvelously deceived in 〈…〉 possibly i do not fully cape their meaning when they say 〈…〉 protest and congregation to persecute another is more unreasonable then all 〈…〉 of the 〈◊〉 church some are ready to take it for an intimation that 〈◊〉 churches of christ in new-england are more cruel and unreasonable than 〈◊〉 romish synagogue like as the anabaptists in germany looked upon such 〈◊〉 luther bullinger calvin zuinglius c. to be worse than the pope and his 〈◊〉 . but i hope they are far from any such insinuation and that they design no other then to suggest unto us that for men whom god hath by his holy spirit made one through faith in christ to be cruel to their brethren is most unreasonable. which assertion though true in thesi if applied to the churches of the lord jesus in this wilderness it is both an erroneous conception 〈◊〉 un just reflection protestants ought not to persecute any yet that protestants may punish protestants and as the case may be circumstanced a congregation of such as call themselves protestants cannot rationally be denied. those of the congregational way as themselves in the preface to their confession of faith have professed fully concurre with the old puritan non-conformists such as cartwright rainold whitaker bains parker c. in whose writings congregational principles about church government are to be seen. now the old 〈…〉 notwithstanding their sufferings from those that took delight to 〈…〉 fellowservants did believe that disorders in whole congregations were 〈◊〉 to the civil magistrates censure as is evident from that excellent and judicious 〈◊〉  called puritanismus anglicanus composed by mr. bradshaw and published by dr. ames. affirment si particular is aliqua ecclesia erraverit magistratus civilis 〈…〉 in 〈◊〉 redigere cap. 2. th. 6. why then should we be r • ndred as men of 〈…〉 rigid spirits and principles when we say nothing but what 〈…〉 puritans worthy confessors and sufferers for the truth 〈◊〉 affirmed. our famous cotton was another moses in respect of meekness and christian forbeatance as to dissenters from his judgement in matters of a lesser concernment yet would he sometimes make a zealous protestation that if magistrates in new-england should tolerate transgressors against the rules of godliness as well as offences contrary to what the rules of honesty require he believed that god would not long tolerate them. and whereas the brethren that have 〈◊〉 the epistle pray the honourable governours in new-england to be careful of doing that which may give occasion of trouble to nonconformists elsewhere i shall heartily joyn with them in the same request and i can assure them that consideration hath caused more indulgence to be exercised towards their friends as they call them here than ever they were worthy of. and i 〈◊〉 it will be so still so far as may consist with scripture rules and the safety of the interest of christs kingdome in this wilderness. these churches are tender vines and i cannot perswade my self that the brethren when they rightly understand things will think that the magistrate should see little foxes spoiling them and should look on all the while as one no way concerned. as for those of the antipaedobaptistical perswasion which differ from us only in that particulars i would speak to them as unto brethren whom their error for so i believed 〈◊〉 is notwithstanding i love and would bear with and exercise the same indulgence and compassion towards them as i would have others 〈◊〉 to me who feel my self compassed with infirmities. i have been a poor labourer in the lords vineyard in this place upwards of twenty years and it is more than i know if in all that time any of those that 〈◊〉 infant- 〈◊〉  have met with molestation from the magistrate meerly on the account of their opinion. i would there 〈…〉 others of their perswasion who may be of a christian and moderate-spirit 〈…〉 have subscribed the epistle seriously to consider 1. that the place may sometimes make a great alteration as to 〈…〉 to be expected. it is evident that that toleration is in one place. not-only lawful but a necessary duty which in another place would be 〈…〉 the expectation of it irrational. that which is needful to ballast a great 〈◊〉 will sink a small boat. if a considerable number of antipaedobaptists should as our fathers here did obtain liberty from the state to transport themselves and families into a wast american wilderness that so they might be a peculiar people by themselves practising all and only the institutions of christ if now 〈◊〉 baptists should come after them and intrude themselves upon them and 〈◊〉 they cast men out of their society for moral scandals entertain them 〈◊〉 they would desire such persons either to walk orderly with them or to return to the place from whence they came. and if they would do neither they would think that such paedo-baptists were blame-worthy let them then do as they would be done by and deal by us as they would have us to deal by them were they in our case and we in theirs. 2. let them please to consider that those of their perswasion in this place have acted with so much irregularity and prophaneness that should men of any other perswasion whatsoever have done the like the same severity would have been used towards them. i truly profess unto them that if any men either of the presbyterian •• congregational or never so much of my perswasion 〈◊〉 matters referring to church-discipline should behave themselves as the 〈◊〉 in boston in new-england have done i think they would have deserved far greater punishment than any thing that to this day hath been inflicted upon them. whether the sentence passed on them by the churches proceeding in the name of the lord jesus were only the abuse of an holy ordinance or a 〈◊〉 process according to scripture rule the following ammadversions 〈…〉 unto those that are willing to weigh matters impartially in the ballance of the sanctuary. how vain is it for men after they have received such excommunicates into their communion and them perceive that the world cries shame on them for it and some of their own perswasion reprove them in stead of abhorring themselves before god and the world and purging out the old 〈◊〉 think they shall come off with saying it was a defect and who in this world 〈◊〉 without their failings and then by retaining such in their communion to persist in their scandal to this very day to parallel the case of the anabaptists in newengland with that of the nonconformists in england seems most unreasonable. do the conforming congregations there cast men out of their fellowship for moral scandalous evils i doubt the godly discipline which their 〈◊〉 confesseth was in the primitive church and should be in theirs is not found amongst them 〈…〉 should i believe the nonconformists would be loth to receive any such into their communion which the new-england anabaptists have done and have 〈◊〉 therein from year to year and that after conviction 〈…〉 in their 〈◊〉 narrative they seek to palliate this offence by 〈…〉 representation of things their iniquity is marked before the 〈…〉 and much so 〈◊〉 will never wash them clean. if then dr. stillingfleet or 〈…〉 shall go about to stir up persecution against conscientious 〈…〉 〈…〉  and endeavour to justifie it by the practice of congregational 〈◊〉 in new-england we see not that any real advantage hath been 〈◊〉  only taken from proceedings here. the author of the 〈◊〉 called the mischief of impositions hath given a fair and 〈◊〉 answer to the doctor as to this particular. they say those of the congregational way in england plead for anabaptists liberty as for their own. that they plead for liberty and indulgence to be extended towards those that differ from them only in that point of paedo-baptisme i believe when i was in england i did so my self and if i were their now i would do so again but that they should plead for liberty unto such practices as our anabaptists have been guilty of is not easie to believe or if they do it is because such narrators as these animadverted upon have by untrue relations misguided them into undue apprehensions. nay i am fully convinced that those of their own way if of serious and gracious spirits when once they are possessed with a true relation of things concerning them will see cause to condemn new-england less and those their friends more than at first they were aware of how did they bear the world in hand that the churches here did excommunicate them for nothing but their opinion in scrupling paedobaptisme but that therein they have dealt most untruely and injuriously the subsequent answer to their narrative hath made apparent from the church-records concerning those matters. finally let me intreat the brethren to believe that some of us would shew as much indulgence unto truly tender consciences as themselves. it is not so long since our own necks bled under an intolerable yoke of imposition upon conscience as that we should forget what it is to be so dealt with or exercise that severity towards any that we have our selves complained of in others. but the brethren will readily own that some men have pretended conscience when pride  perverseness in the will have been at the bottom they will also confess that a meer pretence of conscience is not enough to bear men out in an evil practice. all the difficulty is in discerning the one of these from the other. blessed mr. burroughs in his excellent irenicum hath laid down rules concerning this and if that which he saith pag. 32. be sound doctrine as undoubtedly it is some of our anabaptists have not such characters of a tender conscience upon them as were to be desired. if men will call 〈◊〉 practices by the name of their opinion and when their 〈◊〉 born witness against make out cries that they suffer for their opinion and for their conscience how is it 〈◊〉 or those help them who desire to keep their own consciences pure and with out offence towards god by being faithful according to that capacity the lord hath set them in and giving a due testimony against 〈◊〉 things which they believe provoke him to jealousie and if a 〈◊〉 in this land have declared their agreement with those of 〈◊〉 like perswasion in england as to matters of faith and worship 〈◊〉 not but that there are many godly antipaedobaptists there 〈◊〉 will never declare their agreement with those here as to their 〈◊〉 practices which have been so offensive to christ and unto his people in new-england. boston new-engl. nov. 4. 1681. increase mather. brief animadversions upon the new england anabaptists late narrative wherein the great mistakes by them published are made apparent. section i. there are two things which every one who designs to give the world an account of the history of things done ought principally to endeavour viz. 1. truth of expressions with a plain and full recital of all essential passages thereto belonging. 2. candor in animadverting charitably upon them not setting our malicious glosse upon things deserving a better interpretation which rules if the author of this narrative had in any degree observed this reply had been needless our present business is not to vindicate the doctrine and practise of these churches in point of infant baptisme which if the anabaptists judge not to have been already sufficiently performed we cannot help that but it being so that these churches in new-england are herein charged with persecution raised against that sort of men and both their and our management of affairs depending between them and us in that respect are grosly misrepresented and convincible of manifest falshoods of which they cannot be except willingly ignorant and should no answer be made the world might judge us truly charged as to matter of fact and on that account draw such conclusions as best sure their own apprehensions yea our best friends might possibly be prejudiced at us it was thought needful to prevent a second error by discovering the first. in such a case the wise mans counsel seems applicable prov. 26. 5. concerning the author of this narrative divine providence 〈◊〉 removed him from our endeavours of conviction and the laws 〈◊〉 humanity as well as religion forbid us now to be over severe 〈◊〉 our censures of him his everlasting estate is not my business to 〈◊〉 quire after nor would i at all reflect upon him if an answer 〈◊〉 have been made without it however it being john russel with 〈◊〉 consent of the whole of whom they tell us he was an officer it 〈…〉 them therefore to stand by it as far as they can whom to 〈◊〉 obnoxious and make known to the world so far as they 〈◊〉 made it necessary to do it by this script of theirs is the professed designe of this reply and let the reader take notice that my controversie is with an historian in point of truth and falshood and not with a divine in matter of orthodoxy and error in which we hope the anabaptists will not be angry if we are as tender of our reputation as they were in printing of their pamphlet for the clearing of their innocency. sect. ii. i shall begin with the title which promifeth fair and looks innocently but yet methinks might have done better to have spoken 〈◊〉 and told us indeed what it intended. it is not fair to invite a man with a specious show and then cheat him he calls it a brief narrative and we promised our selves to find an honest toothless 〈◊〉  but upon reading it it seems more fit to be called a saty 〈◊〉 invective for certainly the principal part of it is rather a 〈◊〉 than a narrative or what if we call it a romance which according to the use of the word is a story built upon a real subject but adorned with fictions or a representation of things according as we saney they should be not regarding what they are indeed but let it be a narrative what is the business it hath to acquaint us with considerable passages. sometime the worth and excellency of a thing sometime the newness and strangeness of it render it considerable and sometimes it is very considerable whether the thing be so or no. but what is it that is so consiberable why 〈◊〉 story of the first gathering and further progress of a church of christ in gospel order in boston in new england it is certainly considerable and admirable too that christ should have any church in gospel order in the world since satan and 〈…〉 are so busie so wast and overturn all order partly by secret conspiracies and open persecutions partly by seducing spirits and disorders of erroneous persons such as quakers anabaptists c. but through gods goodness there are more churches then one in gospel order in boston in n. engl. whereas that is rather an ubiquitarian church. but what church may this be which is so eminently observable oh it is a church commonly though falsly called by the 〈…〉  and it is well that it is 〈…〉 else we should hardly have believed it a church in gospel 〈◊〉  because we know baptism is one of the foundations of gospel order heb. 6. 1 2. but are they falsly so called alas for our ignorance we have mistaken the men all this while men render themselves suspected when they deny their names but they have but one baptism therefore not to be called anabaptists but to deal fairly by anabaptists we mean no other but those men that deny the baptism received in infancy to be any baptism and seek another pretended one of their own and thereby undermine the baptisme that hath been practised and owned by all the churches of christ in the world ever since christ excepting a few of their own sect and if the word be not so proper yet being generally used and well understood it pleads custome and may do better then a new one their own term baptists is fallacious insinuating that there are none for baptisme but themselves. next he tells us the moving cause of that narrative which is very honest and good it is for the cleaving of their innocency and that every good man may lawfully do and sometimes ought. the first fathers in the church wrote their apologies. but it were better to be innocent without a plea then to do mischief and then wipe their mouth and say i have done no wickedness. it was high time to purge themselves with a narrative when there were so many scandalous things laid to their charge but if either the things be not laid to their charge that part of their defence will be vain and superfluous or the things laid to their charge be both true and scandalous they will never be able to render them other then so by writing narratives. sect. iii. in the next place we have an epistle to the reader to usher in the narrative dignam patelld operculum. if strangers will needlesly be medling they must thank themselves if they get a blow. they tell us they leave the ensuing apology to plead for it self but it had been friendly to have spoke a word for it it being able to speak to 〈◊〉 for it self yet they are willing to give in their testimony 〈◊〉 that one and the same spirit in christians makes them in passions and affections present though locally distant and extends a follow-feeling with the members of the same body and if that were proper to sincere christians or characteristical of them they had said something but experience lets us know that a spirit of error is as diffusive as that of sincerity and a common cause though bad can tye men up in a combination and conspiracie hence they do well to subjoyn that plea from their perfect agreement in matters of faith and worship for if so then self interest also obligeth them to take part with their brethren and they do it to purpose having squeezed the quintessence of the book into their epistle. the intendment of it is to accuse this government and these churches of persecuting the saints and servants of christ and they begin with the churches where wisely taking the question for granted which might have put them to some difficulty to have proved they endeavour to aggravate our guilt by divers arguments. 1. our practises are contrary to the principles and practises of our 〈◊〉 of the congregational way in england which do equally plead for the liberties of the anabaptists as their own but let them not be angry if we are hard to believe that those of the congregational way in england do judge such anabaptists as these in new-engl. to be as orthodox as themselves and deserve like countenance and favour or that magistrates and churches are no wayes bound to labour according to the power given them to suppress errors scandalously persisted in or to manifest a practical dislike of them is not this to scandalize the congregational churches there that they may better accuse them here 2. our practises are contrary to the design of our first planters who left all for liberty of conscience and we are the children of those that felt the lash of imposition and yet will shew to others the like severity. i perceive they are mistaken in the design of our first planters whose business was not toleration but were professed enemies of it and could leave the world professing they died no • libertines. their business was to settle and as much as in them lay secure religion to posterity according to that way which they believed was of god. if therefore this people parted with so much and were at such charges for their liberties why then do the anabaptists trouble them who had neither scot nor lot in that charge let them go and do the like and we shall not so molest their churches as they have shamefully done by ours. 3. it is against their brethren the sincerity of the expression 〈◊〉 much to be suspected since we know that they do deny us to be so much as visible christians while they declare our baptisme not only to be a mal administration but a meer nullity. but granting it we never could finde that discipline rightly administred was against christian charity and yet the subject of it is brethren yea the neglect of that duty in case would argue want of love if not hatred levit. 19. 17. 4. but they are brethren that avowedly profess and appeal to the same rule but what if the churches in their bearing witness against them do appeal to the same rule and think they should violate it by neglecting this duty how shall we do then why do they censure our church censures against them that have sometimes been our members we do avowedly appeal to the same rule. is it sufficient to satisfie men in one anothers proceedings though contrary because they appeal to the same rule this must certainly be some lesbian rule that may square to all mens opinions and fancies. 5. that the present molestation given them is meerly for a supposed error relating to the subject of baptisme here learn how dangerous a thing it is to take a thing for truth upon the credit of prejudiced persons. how untrue this is there will be afterward occasion in divers examples to make appear only we must give them leave to call it a supposed error but with whom with them it is a believed truth and of such weight that it were better set a fire on the world than not stand up in it's defence and i can assure them with us it is more than a supposed error and yet that that hath been the only ground of their being molested shall also appear to be more than a supposed falshood. 6. it is a matter which hath been and if we believe them is still sub judice controverted and that between learned and judicious holy and good men why then should they be so stiffe for it or we against it it is very weak for men to be so rigid on all hands about a nice controversie and indeterminable question which learned and good men have not these 1600 years known how to determine. but upon search i finde it hath been both professed and defended in all ages by the churches of christ though this truth as many others hath not escaped the opposition of men left by god to a spirit of error but it hath fared as well as almost any great gospel truth god having ever raised up worthy patrons for the defence of it. if fundamental truths must be the more charily or dubiously 〈◊〉 because men 〈◊〉 with error and holding perverse principles yet pretending holiness and what 〈◊〉 ever did other impugne it it would be a plausible way to subvert all. with these arguments they fortifie their conclusion viz. that 〈◊〉 one protestant congregation on such occasions to persecute 〈◊〉 where there is no pretense to infallibility in deciding controversies seem • much more unreasonable then all the 〈◊〉 of the 〈◊〉 church c. before i saw this narrative one told me it was a moderate piece and shewed a christian spirit. if they intend us not in these words they are vain men if they do they render themselves the persecutors pursuing us with bitter words who have this to say that in all our dealings with them we have allowing humane infirmities walked by the golden rule they urge upon us if rightly understood doing as we would be done by. now they have a word of counsel to the governours in new-england to consider their brethren of the congregational way in england left they justifie those that trouble them there. they owe thanks to any that will fairly put them in mind of their duty only in this counsel there lurks a dangerous evil which in retaliation of courtesies they are to be admonished of viz. they forget that the cause evermore alters the quality of the action nor was it ever thought by any of a found minde that justice should not be administred upon offenders left others by misapplication should thence take occasion to wrong the innocent and the honourable governours in new-england have learned and are perswaded that if they should sin by omitting duty for mans sake they should both dishonour god and grieve their brethren. to scare us the more with this they tell us how dr. stilling. fleet improved it to the same purpose against us all i shall say to this is we cannot confess guilty for the censure of those who neither knowing what we do nor weighing the difference of cases which they would make parallels rashly conclude against us we humbly conceive men that are not prejudiced will easily discern that suppressing with all gentleness and tenderness a dangerous error and of bad tendency such as anabaptism especially so circumstanced as in newengland it hath been and the enforcing of ceremonies in religion which are neither directly nor by any good consequence required in or by the word of god do differ toto coelo. for the concluding prayer we can heartily put it up to god and might have joyned with them in it too had they not added it as a cloak to the slander of their epistle. sect. iv. now follows the narrative it self in which the first thing that 〈…〉 us is indeed a brief account of their congregating or that 〈◊〉 of theirs in gathering a church where we have the moving 〈◊〉 the manner and the materials of it. 1. the moving cause of it is brief and pithy it pleased god to 〈◊〉 their hearts and if this be indeed so then those that opposed 〈◊〉 in it and endeavoured to suppress them will be found fighters 〈◊〉 against god and to act in vain for the will of god shall be accomplished and no weapon formed against it shall prosper and this argument we shall finde them making use of page 2. but who knows not that all hereticks pretend to the spirit and direction of god though it's certain that in so doing they take the name of god in vain and it's little less then blasphemy to bring god in to patronize their sinful actions for 1. god doth not graciously move the hearts of any to irregular and unlawful actions and though men are very prone to entitle him to it yet he utterly disclaims it jam. 1. 13 14. 2. and it is certain that when men grow wanton and despise the ordinances god many times judicially gives them strong delusion to believe a lye 2 thess. 2. 10 11. and that is none of the least to misjudge a seducing spirit to be the spirit of god. 3. to follow an erring conscience which verily believes his error to be the truth is not to follow the direction of the spirit of god. if what god forbids conscience perswades this is not of gods approbation for so he should be against himself. it is a snare and a judgement to be under such a conscience so that they must pardon us if we suspect the moving cause. 2. the persons thus moved are described from their former experience of his teaching such whom by his word and spirit he had instructed and taught in the way. c. thus one error begets another what have we to do with the anabaptists kuria dóxa do none but the orthodox bring this plea we expected he should have given us some rules by which we might have known it. it is a piece of arregancy for men to beg the principle or forcibly impose upon our belief that which is the very dispute and controversie between us i. e. whither it be an error or no and they tell us god taught them therefore it is no error true but if we reply it is an error therefore god taught them not where are we now are anabaptists only masters of rules and canons may not we as easily deny as they affirm without proof 3. they entred into solemn covenant to walk in communion in the practice of all the holy appointments of christ c and so became 〈◊〉 church of christ this alone will not make them a church of christ 〈◊〉 for it so then every combination of enthusiasts ranters 〈◊〉 c. may become churches of christ for they do pretend and promise each other in words as much as these or any other churches 〈◊〉 the world can do but there are synagogues of satan too in 〈◊〉 world. if they who are fit to be cast out of churches and are 〈◊〉 actually combine and covenant doth that make them a church 4. they are men of holy and exact walking viz. in the 〈◊〉 and performance of the holy ordinances of christ according to 〈◊〉 institution if men were not proud and confident they would never impose their assertions upon us with an ipse dixit grant but an anabaptist that his opinion is true and he can easily prove that ours is false but if you question that he hath no more to say to you. it is certain they have exploded infant baptisme which hath been acknowledged by the body of the church christian in all ages not only for an institution but a principal institution of christ but if these deny it then we are mistaken. how like holy men they have walked will appear afterwards. 5. he gives us the names of the men who laid this precious foundation and if they had been such men as had done this to begin right church order in new-england they ought not to be forgotten but had in honourable remembrance but if they were and i am afraid the great day will discover that they were the heads and ringleaders of a schisme and culpable cause of great troubles in the churches of christ in new-england they had better been forgotten. sect. v. and now we have a church gathered of such excellent materials and in so regular a way what reception is it they finde in new-england one would think that such a church and in such a place. should have been highly esteemed strenuously defended by the civil magistrate and imitated by all the churches who came into the wilderness on very purpose to serve god in his own way but unhappily missed of it till the anabaptists found it out but lo they meet the quite contrary they are assailed with troubles and afflictions and from whom certainly a vile generation but it must be born they 〈…〉 not the first sufferers for the truth nor for falshood neither it 〈…〉 alwayes befallen those whom god hath singled out from others to bear 〈…〉 to the truth true the world ever persecuted the church 〈…〉 have not the people of god also had their zeal to maintain the 〈◊〉 of god and counted it their duty to use means to suppress 〈…〉 as upon what pretence soever sought to pervert them and if 〈…〉 have proved his people with anabaptists as he is wont to do his 〈◊〉 with seducers who shall blame them that have shown their 〈◊〉 to god in endeavouring to stop their progress and thus the 〈◊〉 sufferings of these men will be a poor argument to prove them 〈◊〉 servants of christ though men may be sufferers yet they are not presently martyrs causa non passio facit martyrem. but these precious saints acted by the right spirit of the old confessors had counted the cost and therefore chearfully past these pikes and are now gone to rest and it is pity to disturb them only it might not be amiss to remember that the vilest hereticks and grossest blasphemers have resolutely and cheerfully at least sullenly and boastingly suffered as well as the people of god histories are pregnant with examples and therefore hitherto they have said nothing to convince any one of their orthodoxy and sincerity they may be right they may be out of the way for all this. sect. vi. we have now done with the narrative handsomely contrived in one page the other fourteen are apologetical which they were put upon for three reasons. 1. to emblazon the names of their dead founders and prevent the worlds being mistaken in them and truly first founders deserve a record and they should be unworthy successors if they did not canonize them though as things are circumstanced some wise men think they had done them a kindness if they had said nothing and to me i am sure for then i had been prevented this undesired task of publishing the follies of men after they are dead. the childe doth his father the best kindness to say nothing of him when by speaking he doth but revive his infamy. but i take it for a just judgement of god on that generation of men that by a fallacious narrative they should enforce us to make the world acquainted with the scandalous conversation of these beginners which had otherwise slept in the private records of those churches wherein they were acted. 2. the very grievous scandals cast upon these beginners 〈◊〉 men if incorrigible deserve to have scandals cast upon 〈◊〉 and if we shall prove these such they must for ought i know 〈◊〉 the reproach of it and thank themselves. but yet there are two things wherein they are to be blamed 〈◊〉 lay scandal to them though just yet it is unjustly done. viz. 1. the frame of spirit they do it with they are rugged 〈◊〉 truly this becomes not men who profess a spirit of meekness 〈◊〉 yet sometimes the gospel calls christians to withstand seducers 〈◊〉 the face to characterize some men in their proper colours and 〈…〉 earnestly with them for the truth yea experience tells us 〈◊〉 such a rough thing as a new-england anabaptist is not to be handle ever tenderly the spirit which they have at all times discovered under the greatest disadvantages and god grant that they may never have more advantage over us easily tells us what they would have been if circumstanced as those whom they accuse. 2. a wicked end and a good action may be spoiled by a bad design at bottom we have charged them on purpose to make them odious and make the world believe them a people not fit to live men wonderfully sagacious and extreamly charitable i dare say none of ours ever told them this was thier end why might they not have interpreted it zeal paul so interpreted his persecuting country-men. but suppose it be made appear that we have not endeavoured to render their persons odious but only their perverse doctrine and that we have used all meekness patience gentleness towards men in that capacity we took them to be in for any such passage of any of ours as judging them not fit to live i know not of it nor i believe do they nor do we patronize any such expression though since their book hath so many in it i know not why this may not go for one of their mistakes and now they appeal to god we accept it readily. sect. vii. their great sufferings are of two forts. 1. in estate and liberties of which we must not expect a particular account  are charitably to think it is because they are tender of our reputation but errorsly in generals a particular account might have been more satisfying. these things look directly upon our magistracy in vindication of them a word will suffice. two things take up this discourse the persecution and the success. 1. the persecution is compendiously represented. some of 〈◊〉 were oftentimes brought before councils c. i suppose they allude to mat. 10. 17. to which let this be taken as a reply viz. that as the honoured magistrates here are christian so have they judged it their duty to maintain the ways of christ and strengthen them by civil laws which hath not only been the practice of reformers of old but the constant judgement of the church of christ ever since the apostles. if evil minded men will take this advantage to oppress the truth it is no more then may be done in all other cases  as it is thought no good plea to keep the scriptures from the laity lest they should learn to be hereticks so neither to deny the magistrate his due power on supposition that he may abuse it. on this principle our worthy rulers have made laws against many sects and intruders and among the rest the anabaptists. that in quelling the anabaptists they do not oppose the truth but suppress error they are fully perswaded and although they never pretended to a lordship over mens consciences yet they account the outward man is subject to them and if we must tarry till all men are agreed about what is truth before we oppose error we shall stay till there is no need 〈◊〉 . for the progress of our magistracy in the execution of these laws they have been so far from a violent eager or willing taking advantage against these men that notwithstanding their opprobrious speeches when they have been before them their scornful carriages and purposed indeavours to irritate them by insolent challenges they have alwayes proceeded slowly tenderly far on this side the law as those who sought not to ruine either their names liberties or estates. how often when fines have been laid upon them have they stopt the execution if any have been imprisoned it hath been but when dared to it and though once a sentence of banishment did pass upon two of their ring-leaders heady violent men yet then they neglected and scorned to take notice of it resolving to run utmost hazards neither was this improved as any advantage against them. nor is it to be wondred that our governours have been opposite in particular to these men since if they could get head among us they would certainly undermine the churches ruine order destroy piety and introduce prophaness. 2. for the success of these endeavours god is pleased still to uphold them and they are by these means not weakened but strengthened and increased methinks i hear the jews crying we are delivered to do 〈◊〉 these abominations. let them but remember that many things are done by gods permissive providence when the doers have not his approbation nor is it an unfailing ground of sincerity that they have withstood such trials and are increased we know do what we can to restrain them evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse and many shall follow their pernicious wayes. nor is it to be wondred at that persons discontent with the yoke of christ in the churches or taking offence at particular administrations which might touch their own interest have so readily followed the faction of the anabaptists of which sort of men the most of their society and founders here have consisted. sect. viii. 2. their great sufferings in their name and it should seem there are many terms of reproach cast upon them pardon them then if they are very tender of their reputation. only they should have gone orderly to work first to have got a good name and then to have kept it by walking worthy of it. here we have a file of scandalous things laid to their charge they might have done well to have told us where and by whom that we might have compared them but i see we must do what we can and consider what is charged and how justly and whither they are wipe i away in their defense. these are no fewer then eight let us examine them. 1. they are a schismatical company who have rent themselves from the churches of christ and received into their society such as have disorderly left the churches. ans. this charge in termes was never made against them by us and so part of their vindication is superfluous for we never said all of them rent from these churches some were strangers to us till their trubulency made them too well known and others were never joyned to other churches but had lived without communion. but that they are a society of schismaticks if schisme be an unjust renting from a church of christ we assert. three things they in words grant. 1. that our churches are churches of christ page 14. 2. that some of them were once members of them page 4. 3. that some of theirs did depart from these churches and joyn in this new combination page 5. now to prove them hence a company of schismaticks observe 1. that whosoever combine with and encourage schismaticks have fellowship with them in their sin. 2. that thomas gold and thomas osborn the persons in dispute were schismaticks or did unjustly rend from the church where they were before members will appear by a true relation of matters of fact for this story of the narrative and truth are strangers whereof there is sufficient testimony to be found in the records of the church at charlstown whereof they were members and there are many faithful witnesses yet alive who were present at these transactions and can say if these things be not so which ought to outweigh the story of a prejudiced person who hath all by hearsay whose very business is to palliate and lick over matters to shape them to his own turn here 1. for goodman gold let the reader consider these things and let the anabaptists disprove them if they can. 1. that though he was first called to an account about withholding his childe from baptisme yet that was not the reason of his being admonished as the pamphlet asserts nor because he could not be convinced of error not yet did the church proceed to admonition till such time as he not only spake contemptuously and irreligiously of the emptiness  nullity of that ordinance but also used unbecoming gestures in the time of administration of which being asked the reason he before the congregation acknowledged they were to cast disresect upon it nor then neither till after much patience. now let anabaptists themselves judge whither there be not a vast difference between doubting about an ordinance and professedly vilifying of it by unhandsome words and carriages and whither they will bear with any member of theirs that will so contemn any of those things which are to them sacred and acknowledged as christs institutions. 2 that at his first admonition he was not sententially suspended but only desired for the preventing of the offence of some to abstain from coming to the other sacrament. 3. that upon this thomas gold took up a trade of absenting himself from the meetings of the church to worship god on the sabbath which made a new offence. 4. that the church in much tenderness waited upon him and after many provocations proceeded not to excommunication but tried with admonition upon admonition and that by the space of seven or eight years nor was he excommunicated till 〈◊〉 having left his own. he joyned to another society without the churches leave or once asking it and now also being twice sent for by the church 〈…〉 their authority over him. 5. that thomas gold did not leave the church at charlstown on the account of the anabaptists new church as is pretended but had many years before renounced his submission to that church. 6. that he did while under admonition neglect publick worship and gather a private meeting on the sabbath to his house. 7. that he did contrary to the judgement of anabaptists themselves wickedly slight the admonition of the church declaring that they had by it discharged him of all relation to them. 2. for thomas osborne the churches proceedings with him were with the like patience as to thomas gold only it is to be observed that his first offence which this dissembling pamphlet finding it disadvantagious wilfully passeth over was this whereas it is one thing which church-members engage to upon admission to walk with the church in constant attendance upon publick worship he without notifying any offence did withdraw and separate frequenting those schismatick meetings at golds on the sabbath this was the offence where was the narrators conscience mean while nor did he when first dealt with pretend any disl • ke of infant baptisme but that the church gave no liberty to private brethren to prophesie that they limited the ministry to learned men and 〈◊〉 he did not find his own spirit free to come though afterwards he 〈◊〉 both of that and of their severity to the quakers though that church medled not with them but only to preach against their errors. in this practice he contumaciously persisted many years denying himself to be subject to that church or bound to assemble with them though he had solemnly given himself up to them in covenant slighting many admonitions and afterwards with thomas gold went off to and became a worthy pillar of an anabaptist church. and whereas he insists so upon a bitter spirit in the church against dissenters let seven years patience with serious endeavours in all tenderness to reclaim them speak whither it be not an audacious slander. and now reader judge are these a church of schismaticks or no sect. ix. 2. that we are scandalous in three respects. 1. the foundation was laid with excommunicate persons. 2. we called such to administer holy things who were justly for scandal cast out of 〈◊〉 churches. 3. for receiving such into our society. ans.. this is indeed the charge from the just imputation 〈◊〉 all their tergiversations excuses suppressions of the truth and suggestions of falshood shall never acquit them. i find not that he denies the first proposition viz. that those who do such things adding the word justly to the first part of the charge are to be reputed scandalous. that they have so done remains to be proved. 1. their foundation was laid with persons excommunicated and that for scandal for this it may be considered. 1. thomas gold was not admonished for his opinion nor doth it appear that ever he should if he had carried humbly but for opprobrious words and carriages against an ordinance. which he himself had before professedly reverenced and highly esteemed and which he knew that church he walked with had still in the like esteem. and thomas osborne by relinquishing publick worship directly violated his covenant not so much as pretending at first any doubt about infant baptisme. 2. they both of them despised the church continued to absent themselves laid false charges against them separated in a private meeting went off to the anabaptists without asking leave and so became supposed members of one before they were regularly discharged of their obligation to another church all which things are against the anabaptists own professed rules if they will stand to their confession. whereas he faith their not hearing the church was nothing else but their not coming when the church sent for them it is a foolish pretence their not hearing the church was their appearing and proving themselves impenitent and that after many treaties used with them many solemn admonitions laid upon them convictions sufficiently offered of sins against the light of their consciences and which it's certain they would have acknowledged had it not been for fear of being reconciled to the church whose excommunication they feared not but impudently des • red. the truth is they were weary of their church relation and resolved to get rid of it and not knowing any regular way to obtain it they chose to sin rather then suffer and undergo a just excommunication that they might be by themselves presuming that they could blind the world with a vain pretense that they were ejected for no other reason but because they questioned the right of infant baptisme. hence thomas gold did particularly express before the church his desire to be excommunicated which yet they proceeded not to till by a first and second refusal to appear at the churches citing of them they proved themselves incorrigible. besides it is to be observed that these men having privately exercised their gifts in meetings with applause began to think themselves wronged that their light was put under a bushel and finding no remedy in our churches threw on a cloak of anabaptisme and so gained the thing they aimed at in a disguise. 2. they called such to administer c. against all his winding to get clear of this only say thomas gold was thus imployed concerning whom too much hath been said except we had better to say. 3. they have received such as have justly for moral evils been cast out of other churches adde and never given christian satisfaction. here he endeavours a salvo. the persons instanced are thomas foster and john farnham the former sometimes of the church as billerica. the other of the second gathered church in boston. he acknowledgeth they have received them but on just reasons or at worst not very irregularly. let the records of these churches be compared with this narrative and see if the anabaptists have not good skill in painting and putting a fair face on a foul matter. 1. for thomas foster let it be observed. 1. that he was not only a member of the church of billerica but of the foundation and at their gathering was full free and forward in owning infant baptisme to be as ordinance of christs institution and if he judged himself that notwithstanding to have been then a true christian he ought to have extended more charity then his after expressions shewed to the church still remaining of the same perswasion. 2. that he first discovered his receding from that formerly received judgement by disorderly carriage at the time of administration of that ordinance and being reproved for it he confessed he had carried unbecoming any person in any christian assembly which gave satisfaction to the church. 3. though when about three months after this he began and thence continued to leave the meeting at the celebration of baptism he was at a private church meeting given to understand that it grieved the brethren and that he had receded from his covenant and was advised solemnly and seriously to consider of it yet he was not as the narrator asserts laid under admonition or prohibited communion nor did the church ever do any such thing in private to any which he knew nor did they intend for this to have debarred him of communion. 4. that after this he neglected the church assemblies and frequented the anabaptist meetings and was there rebaptized and being called by the church at a meeting at the pastors house to give an account of these proceedings though at first he dissembled yet at length acknowledged and justified his actions if false charges may be accounted a justification for he told them 1. that they had laid him under sin whereas he thought he had not 〈◊〉 amiss but they had not so done judicially though they told him 〈◊〉 carriage was a grief to his brethren nor as i have said before 〈◊〉 intended it so far is the narration from speaking truth when it 〈◊〉 nothing but matter of conscience was or could be laid to his charge. 2. that they denied him baptisme whereas they owned him for baptized and if he was not it was wickedness in him an unbaptized person to come to the lords table. 3. that they yoked him with unbelievers which was because they extended church watch to a child or children of the church and yet for this he judged his separation lawful and produced for it 2 cor. 6. 14 15 17. therein implicitly at least pronouncing the church a company of belialists and infidels. 4. that they had presented him to the court the truth is one of the brethren of the church had made complaint of him to the grand-jury which occasioned his presentment judging his freemans oath engaged him so to do when other due means to reclaim him from his turbulent carriages had been used and this he makes the churches fault because they did not lay that brother under a censure for not daring to violate his oath and betray his fidelity to the civil authority. 5. that they had dealt injuriously by one of his brethren in laying him under admonition in justification of which act there needs no account be given here only let any judge whither it be a just ground to separate from a church because i am not fully of their mind in every act of administration and also it seems a thing not warrantable for a private member of a church in pretence of selfvindication to vilifie and asperse a church of christ if this be humility what is pride but yet 5. the church still continued to labour his conviction and when they could not obtain it after much patience they called him forth in publick charged him with offensive departing and rending away from the church denying himself a subject of discipline and vilifying the church by 〈◊〉 charges he observing on ready to write his answer refused to speak any thing unless he were forbidden and not obteining it essayed to depart yea though required by the officer to stay and hear the church he wilfully withdrew on the following sabbath he was for these carriages admonished and debarred communion and not till then and after some patience used being called forth again to see if it repented him he remained obstinate and was therefore excommunicated and now compare notes and see what will become of john russel's consectaries as for his retaining the respect of a very godly man where he is known which is so boasted of it must be only among men void of reason for though we will not say but he may have the root in him yet he hath blasted profession by wicked wayes impenitently persisted in and thereby wounded such mens charity who judge as they ought of the tree by the fruit. sect. x. 2. relating to john farnum we have him confessing guilty in some things acknowledging a defect but would not have it thought wilful nor such as any church in their imperfection may not easily fall into well they can make great faults little and small ones none at all. in sober earnest we may say of this act of theirs about farnum that if in nothing else they had been guilty yet that is enough to render them low in the hearts of any good men and a shame to anabaptists themselves. a little in so dirty a matter is enough to be said therefore 1. they say when he walked in fellowship with the church he was in reputation among them for a very godly man. they should have left the word very out though in charity they had hopes he might have the root of the matter in him yet he was never judged eminent for his piety it was long ere he could obtain admission into the church at dorchester  some discerning christians ever suspected him to be john farnum such an one as he after proved. 2. that he was deputed by them for a deacon and yet neither the present teacher nor any that have been added to the church these twenty years either deputed or thought him fit for that office and whereas there is but one surviving of the founders of that church he professeth there is never a syllable of truth in that report. 3. that the churches 〈◊〉 was 〈◊〉 upon account of his opinion. 4. the rugged spirit in these men against 〈◊〉  was the 〈◊〉 his withdrawing. 5. other things were gathered to this having a face of scandal. a true survey of the churches proceedings will shew the vanity of these assertions for 1. the church did not so much as deal with him till he had wholly withdrawn communion from them refusing so much as to hear the word preached with them for many months no nor so much as declared themselves offended with him. what now is this rugged spirit 2. when he alledged his opinion the teacher of the church though possibly some may think he did more than the rule required declared to him that if he were so weak as not to think it lawful to see a child baptized his withdrawing when that ordinance was administered should not be imputed as an offence how is it then that his judgement was the principal thing in that process 3. his offence for which he was dealt with was many moral evils and so a complicate offence breaking forth at once viz. 1. renouncing communion with the church contrary to heb. 10. 24. 2. holding familiarity with excommunicate persons contrary to math. 18 17. 2. thess. 3. 6 14. 3. slanders against several holy and worthy men now with christ. 4. that having been often reproved for these things he still persisted. when the elders reproved him for these slanders he replied that they might be offended at a thousand things he cared not and that there was never an elder in newengland was willing any should read the scripture but themselves after this he was called before the church tenderly dealt with and those scripture rules which he had transgressed were applied to his conscience but in vain. at the third church meeting on his account octob. 16. 1665. the pastor mr. mayo told him it wos expected that after so much patience he should manifest repentance. his reply was that he desired none of their patience he was humbled for his sins. the teacher mr. mather saying to him we must see it by the fruits he retorted you see it you shall never see it some brethren told him his speeches and carriage were very sinful they had never seen the like be replied i did not come hither to be 〈◊〉 and 〈◊〉 at by every one and so he turned his back to depart the pastor wished him to stay and hear what further they had to say and seeing him still proceed charged him in the name of the church and of christ to stay he rejoyned 〈…〉 christ to me i am not out that can how and stoop 〈…〉   exit. the same day he told some of the brethren that he wished the church would excommunicate him and then he should be of a better society. on all these accounts was he laid under admonition. two months after which being called before the church he in words confest the evil of some of the particulars but was observed at the same time to turn about and laugh where then was his repentance the church this notwithstanding waited divers months longer till he went on to that height of impiety and prophaneness that one of the teaching officers setting before the church the rule concerning excommunication farnum makes a leg to him in the assembly in way of derision and declared that except the church would yield to four things he would have no communion with them viz. 1. they must set up the ordinance of 〈◊〉 . 2. promise to baptize no more infants. 3. all be baptized i. e. rebaptized themselves. 4. put away their present and still continuing teacher from his office. upon these things the church concluded upon his censure only allowing him another months patience after which no repentance appearing they proceeded. now judge 1. whither these things have no more than a face of scandal and that too only as they are taken and construed. 2. whither their admission of him were not more than a meer defect in those who so admitted him yea a meer scandal stinking in the no • thrils of moral men. 3. whither if it were but a defect it were not a wilful one since they either had or might have had an account of the churches proceedings with him and ought to have inquired after the true cause of his excommunication before they received him. well it was but a little fault and a little amendment was enough and what was that when clamors were revived and renewed and then to speak of open and notorious wickedness if it be approved by a society of an baptists is clamour. but it's well a clamour roused them whom serious warnings and informations could not. and now the church in good time are dissatisfied and determine to make search but they knew before that he was excommunicated only because he was an anabaptist they concluded it was for his opinion we see what harm too much credulity doth men. now they send messengers c. procure a copy of proceedings and are convinced better late then never suspend him bring him to give them satisfaction advise him to satisfie the church he had offended patcht cobling work a good shoe-maker would have scorn'd it. who appointed the anabaptist church to be a 〈◊〉 court of 〈…〉 to judge cases for and receive satisfaction on the account of 〈◊〉 church in respect of any of their members ex 〈…〉 this teacheth us what lordly men they would be had they advantage. but he did apply himself to that church and all were well satisfied but one how did goodman russel know this suppose all but one remained dissatisfied nay what if not so much as one was well satisfied where are we then except he know them better then they know themselves both the elder and brethren utterly deny the truth 〈◊〉 this passage it is true indeed he did once and again in 〈◊〉 acknowledge that the church had exercised patience towards him and that he had been guilty of sin and great evil both in word and action and orally before the church he confessed he had done very wickedly and was ashamed of himself the church then had done well. but why is he not then upon this restored alas this he sought not but the very next day declared that if he should return into communion with that church it would be the greatest sin that ever he had been guilty of in his life which made the brethren suspect his confession to be insyncere and yet this satisfies the anabaptists they still continue to hold communion with a vile person justly cast out not seeing to be restored and therefore by the will of christ to be counted and carried to as an heathen and a publican. sect. xi. 3. that we are disorderly and walk disorderly. for all his 〈◊〉 excuse and abuse of scripture in it there needs no more but to consider whither it be not to walk disorderly to receive into their communion persons that are under church dealing for moral evils yea excommunicate impenitents and not to withdraw from them after they have confessed they missed it in so doing. if this be not disorder to set up a church for a sanctuary or city of refuge for scandalous men who scorning to submit to the discipline of christ presently take up anabaptisme and know where to be made welcome we may then enquire whither there be any such thing as disorder. sect. xii. 4. we are disturbers of the publick p • ace that this hath 〈◊〉  been charged upon them i find not but that they have made disturbance among us is true what else have been the 〈…〉 of some now theirs when of other churches with the courses they have taken to make parties what their many complaints into england and misrepresentations of us to render us as obnoxious as might be and what this narrative sect. xiii. 5. that we are under miners of the churches and is not this true neither alas that in all things we should so mistake but this we mean that such of these men as sometimes stood in relation to other churches fought to draw others away with them witness thomas gol • 's private meeting in his own house for many years where living two miles distant from the publick place of worship their neighbours i speak things known were drawn in and there were the churches 〈◊〉 and ministers scoffed at and means used to alienate mens hearts and not only so but they have published to the world that infant baptisme is a nullity that we are churches of unbaptized men and women and have unbaptized officers by these pleas seeking to draw men off and if this be their reduction it is in vain distinguished from destruction and is properly seduction. adde to this their readiness to receive any discontented persons so that if any be under offence in any of our churches though he be never so vile let him but turn anabaptist they will take up his case if he can satisfie them and we may think a little will do let his own seek it where they can get •  is not this undermining nay have they not by that unjust 〈◊〉  and false reports done more hurt to the churches of christ in new-england than all their enemies in the world besides sect. xiv. 6. we neglect publick worship on the lords day what he brings are for justification is to us a confessing guilty that is it we mean and therefore what we say is not utterly untrue only the reasons 〈◊〉 give for their separation are misrepresented. whereas they 〈◊〉 mould not admit any of them to communion with us they know 〈◊〉 our churches have received some that were scrupulous about 〈◊〉 baptisme who were willing to carry inoffensively that we have • used such as were rebaptized among these excommunicate ana 〈◊〉 is true by 〈◊〉 viz. except they would acknowledge 〈◊〉 repent of that act because we judge it scandalous. and 〈…〉 the world we have been shut out of our publick house and 〈…〉 nailed up and we forced to meet without in the open air on a 〈◊〉 old day he seems to have forfeited all honestly so to relate it is true the civil authority here have by a 〈…〉  prohibited any from erecting any publick meeting house 〈◊〉 the consent of the freemen of the town where they live first orderly had and obtained at a publick meeting assembled for that end and license of the county court c. without such a law many hopeful plantations would have come to nothing. and it equally concerned all others with anabaptists and yet these men neglecting this law undertake such a business. report of this is made to the civil magistrate who enquired into it and these fallaciously pretend it might be for a warehouse or a brew-house that they still proceed till it become a meeting house and is met in on the lords dayes now are they again called before the council justly reproved for slighting the law and for dissimulation and lovingly desired to be content to meet in private as before till the general court near approaching might hear and determine this matter. they refusing to promise so to do. order was given to nail up their doors whereupon the anabaptists sullenly meet in the open air on a cold day though a large house and their usual place of meeting stood just by that they might make matter to frame a scandalous clamour out of yet were the doors soon broken open again and they there publickly meet before the court. now only desire to be satisfied who gave these men leave to trample all authority under foot and live as men that are lawless sect. xv. 7. that we are idolaters for this they quote the late synod-book but there is no such word there we have not been afraid to charge them with the breach of the second commandment. every declining from the rules of worship omission or alteration of divine institutions without immediate warrant from the law giver is against that command. sect. xvi. 8. we are charged to be enemies of civil government. i find no such charge the first germane anabaptists were so we hope these though they have shown too much contempt of authority are not so far gone. but for his so gloriously •• blazoning their service in the late wars it is neither to the purpose nor of much moment. that they did joyn against the common enemy is true swanzy a place chiefly consisting of anabaptists and where they had a church was the place where the enemy made the first onset which church 〈◊〉 being one of two was as much removed as our four of above forty they so 〈◊〉 upbraid us with page 15. besides 〈…〉 would fight rather than have his throat cut it was not for religion nor civil government but for lives and estates. for captain turner we have not abridged him ought of his due acknowledgement in what hath been published. but for his acts at connecticut falls they are hyperbolically discribed for 1. there was another captain and his company joyned with him in that undertaking a man of appoved valour and conduct which at that time he discover •• 〈…〉 prudent drawing off his men. 2. captain turner was at that time by sickness disabled from doing much. 3 god saw meet to obscure the victory by the affrighted and disorderly retreat of our men the slaughter of many and death of captain turner. nor did the indians receive the greatest blow at that time nor is it the anabaptists true but vain glory to set such an encomium upon their own deeds. sect. xvii. we have dismissed the charge now comes a strong argument of their orthodoxy a witness from heaven viz. their happy preservation in the 〈◊〉 of the small pox let it be remembred that one of their perswasion did of it at woborn where john russel lived and should have observed it and many of their children. but be it so their society is small and scattered from dan to beersheba. and who knows but god might spare them in judgement to harden them these things are too high for us only when god comes to chasten his people those that are not chastened may ask whither they are no bastards. sect. xviii. and now he had done had not a book of mr. mather's come out to which he hath a few words to say and a few he thinks are enough to confute so weak and silly a piece it is titled the divine right of infant baptisme ans. sooner said then proved. excellently refuted but he hath a word more in general and one or two in particular to say to it. 1. in general any sober unbyassed christian may be satisfied that the main or one main design of it is to render all that are nicknamed anabaptists as odious as he could i am sorry for it that so good a look should have so bad a design but he is no unbyassed christian who asserts it and it is strange that that worthy man whose charity hath been so large to such men as is well known should be thus guilty and if he be truly it is very unhappy. but divers that have 〈◊〉 the book cannot spy it i fear it is a suspicious 〈◊〉 censorious slander. for his arguments it's answered they are no new ones and i like them the better verissimum est antiquissimum had he brought novel pleas i had suspected him as i do for that reason the anabaptists nay he tells us page 2. he intends old arguments and no other. but what then they must have no new answer being sufficiently confuted already. i am glad of that he saves me some labour by it. he blames him not for disputing for what he believes nor i neither but think he deserves commendation and god hath blessed it to the reclaiming of several that way inclined and settling many more in the truth. but why should mr. mather wickedly injure holy men by arguing an opinion must needs he bad because the professors of it have miscarried. but mr. mather hath expresly declared against any such conclusion. page 25. this is the sum of his argument. that opinion which hath been attended with signal judgements on the first and chief assertors of it and generality of those that have especially at first embraced it is to be suspected as erroneous. and is it any harm for men to suspect themselves when god seems to frown on them do not the anabaptists allow this argument and therefore plead that god kept and increased them under persecution page 2 and wonderfully preserved them in times of sickness page 12. which they desire may be observed though this is of little weight because these are not the first nor the chief. and do not the generality of the orthodox improve this argument against hereticks doth not john russel use it against us page 15. what besel corinthus manicheus arius c. dr. beards theater of gods judgements mr. clarks examples and others may speak for this. nay was it not thus with korah with ananias and saphira and for gods judicially leaving them to scandalous evils. see mat. 7. 15 16. 2. tim. 3. 13. and what befel the first anabaptists see sleidan's commentaries and other authors of great note quoted by mr. mather. sect. xix. 2. but there is a thing or two in particular which he 〈◊〉 pass they touch him so near. mr mather chargeth them with the sin of jeroboam but they are not concerned in or with it. the text alluded to is i kings 12.3 1. the original is jeroboam made priests of the extremities of the people both ends comprehend the whole see 〈◊〉 in ezek. 33. 1. it was 〈◊〉 sin that any that would might under him be made priest fit or unfit. the belgick and others read it of both ends of the people. if a fit man would accept it so if not to the other end and take one unfit. the anabaptists would have a learned man if they could get one of their mind if not john russel the shoemaker. the learned zepperus. depolit. eccl. p. 186. lamenting the low and miserable estate of religion gives this for one reason of it they make ministres de 〈◊〉 populist i. e. sartoribus sutoribus idiotis c. he doth not think the spirit is locked up in the narrow limits of colledge learning. nor we neither nor yet ministerial gifts to be ordinarily acquired in a shoemakers shop. we believe men are to be instructed and endeavours used and that there are schools of the prophets to that end or there may be private means used. we believe a learned man may prove v • tious and so not fit to improved in that work. we believe every true christian receives the spirit in his measure but that he therefore is fit to teach and instruct a congregation is an enthusiastical notion. truly if goodman russel was a fit man for a minister we have but fooled our selves in building colledges and instructing our children in learning. frange leves calamos  scinde thalia sebellos si dare sutori calceus ista potest. mart. we have enough of his last to people new-england with prophets. sect. xx. one thing more and he will dismiss us mr. mather chargeth them with a pernicious principle in their confession of faith viz. that believers baptized are visible christians and fit matter for a visible church. how may the altering of a word or two change the sence the words of their confession are believers being baptized are visible saints and true matter of a visible church. hence if the anabaptists would give leave to draw consequences but then they would never have done with us and that is the reason they cannot receive our arguments for infant baptisme because they are nothing but a few consequences and that is nothing to the purpose a man might argue that believers being unbaptized are not visible saints  we know they acknowledge none baptized but themselves and that will bring in another consequence that there are no visible saints but anabaptists but suppose a man cannot reach them a blow with a consequence let them yet say is baptisme administred to persons within the visible church or without it besides they say baptized persons are true matter of a visible church 〈…〉 were only sprinkled in their infancy were never baptized 〈…〉 not this undermine the foundation of all the churches in the 〈…〉 but theirs and what more pernicious they had even as good 〈◊〉 with edom' sons raze it raze it to the foundation. and now he cannot chuse but burst out into a lamentation over such a spirit but thus it will be in the world that the joy of some will be made the grief of others the triumph of 〈◊〉 will be the mourning of error i pray god this cause of the 〈…〉 may be continued by the constant supply 〈◊〉 men zealous against errors. sect. xxi. for a conclusion the narrator turns prophet  gets up to the top of mount ebal and there curses the people of god or these churches in new-england and what is it so stirs his splene why they have born their witness faithfully against anabaptists errors and scandals and detected the sin of those men who after they have for lyes' slanders covenant breaking despising gods ministers and slighting the admonitions of their respective churches been in christs name delivered up to satan have joyned themselves in erecting and establishing in anti-temple and like the samaritans of old become a mount gerizzim a den and receptacle for every mal-content and scandalous person that cannot submit to the discipline of christ in his churches to repair unto. and now for this they are compared to those damnable hypocrites mentioned mat. 24. 49. and threatned with no less then eternal desolation. we see what men may come to in time 〈◊〉 with falshoods and end with cursings. but causeless curses shall not come nor need these churches regard if they keep faithful to their god though anabaptists anathematize them. \n"

       "u\" ne sutor ultra crepidam. or brief animadversions upon the new-england anabaptists late fallacious narrative wherein the notorious mistakes and falshoods by them published are detected. by samuel willard teacher of a church in boston in new-england. prov. 18. 17. he that is first in his own cause seemeth just but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. rom. 16. 17. now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them. 18. for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009  and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. boston in new-england printed by green upon assignment of sewall. and are to be sold by \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 philips at the west end of the exchange 1681. to the reader. the anabaptists in new-england have in their narrative lately published endeavoured to make candida de \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009  de \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009  themselves the innocent person and the lords servants \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 no better than persecutors. in which respect it hath been \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 necessary that some one should \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 upon what they \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 done that so such persons as have been \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 by their untrue relation may be disabused. many are of the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 it is not worth the while to take notice of what \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 by men so obscure and inconsiderable. and i \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 i have though \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 self so far as i am personally concerned in any of their reflections \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 shall \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 lose precious time in a needless desence. \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009  furore ego \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 contemptu  vincit \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009  in christ. it seems to me that the reverend author of the following \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 versions hath shewed much humility in condescending to take persons in hand between whom and himself there is such an impar congressus and let it be that for this once. he hath contradicted that proverbial saying aquils non capit muse as had he not been sensible that by good words and fair speeches the hearts of the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 are deceived this pains would have been spared. i verily believe that the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 baptists by their fallacious narrative have grievously offended god \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 the things by them misrepresented were not done a far off for then mistakes about them would have been excusable but at home where right information was easie to have been obtained had they been willing to have \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 others should have known the truth. and by this means have they done ill \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 themselves forcing others to discover the enormities of some whose \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 and shame should not have been divulged to the world and to posterity forever but slept in a grave of silence had not their own narrative brought them forth. they have also by letters misrepresented worthy and honourable persons as well as things and their reports have been received elsewhere with too much readiness and credulity as i perceive by certain complainants whosay they understand that the present honourable governour of this colony had threatned this poor people their christian friends as they stile them with death which \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 report of theirs is like too many particulars in their vindication an utter \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 quil \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 . the governour whose integrity wisdome and \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 is well known hath sometimes moved that an old severe law made against those that should manifest any publick contempt of that ordinance of infant \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 might be lenifyed. so far is the scandalous report which they have raised upon the governour and caused it to fly three thousand miles from being true. as for the brethren that have thought good to prefix an epistle to such a narrative and there \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 declare that molestation is given and severity is exercised towards \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 england meerly for a supposed error about the subject of \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009  and holy men they are marvelously deceived in \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 possibly i do not fully cape their meaning when they say \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 protest and congregation to persecute another is more unreasonable then all \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 of the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 church some are ready to take it for an intimation that \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 churches of christ in new-england are more cruel and unreasonable than \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 romish synagogue like as the anabaptists in germany looked upon such \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 luther bullinger calvin zuinglius to be worse than the pope and his \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 . but i hope they are far from any such insinuation and that they design no other then to suggest unto us that for men whom god hath by his holy spirit made one through faith in christ to be cruel to their brethren is most unreasonable. which assertion though true in thesi if applied to the churches of the lord jesus in this wilderness it is both an erroneous conception \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 un just reflection protestants ought not to persecute any yet that protestants may punish protestants and as the case may be circumstanced a congregation of such as call themselves protestants cannot rationally be denied. those of the congregational way as themselves in the preface to their confession of faith have professed fully concurre with the old puritan non-conformists such as cartwright rainold whitaker bains parker in whose writings congregational principles about church government are to be seen. now the old \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 notwithstanding their sufferings from those that took delight to \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 fellowservants did believe that disorders in whole congregations were \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 to the civil magistrates censure as is evident from that excellent and judicious \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009  called puritanismus anglicanus composed by mr. bradshaw and published by dr. ames. affirment si particular is aliqua ecclesia erraverit magistratus civilis \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 in \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 redigere cap. th. why then should we be r \\u2022 ndred as men of \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 rigid spirits and principles when we say nothing but what \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 puritans worthy confessors and sufferers for the truth \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 affirmed. our famous cotton was another moses in respect of meekness and christian forbeatance as to dissenters from his judgement in matters of a lesser concernment yet would he sometimes make a zealous protestation that if magistrates in new-england should tolerate transgressors against the rules of godliness as well as offences contrary to what the rules of honesty require he believed that god would not long tolerate them. and whereas the brethren that have \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 the epistle pray the honourable governours in new-england to be careful of doing that which may give occasion of trouble to nonconformists elsewhere i shall heartily joyn with them in the same request and i can assure them that consideration hath caused more indulgence to be exercised towards their friends as they call them here than ever they were worthy of. and i \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 it will be so still so far as may consist with scripture rules and the safety of the interest of christs kingdome in this wilderness. these churches are tender vines and i cannot perswade my self that the brethren when they rightly understand things will think that the magistrate should see little foxes spoiling them and should look on all the while as one no way concerned. as for those of the antipaedobaptistical perswasion which differ from us only in that particulars i would speak to them as unto brethren whom their error for so i believed \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 is notwithstanding i love and would bear with and exercise the same indulgence and compassion towards them as i would have others \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 to me who feel my self compassed with infirmities. i have been a poor labourer in the lords vineyard in this place upwards of twenty years and it is more than i know if in all that time any of those that \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 infant- \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009  have met with molestation from the magistrate meerly on the account of their opinion. i would there \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 others of their perswasion who may be of a christian and moderate-spirit \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 have subscribed the epistle seriously to consider that the place may sometimes make a great alteration as to \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 to be expected. it is evident that that toleration is in one place. not-only lawful but a necessary duty which in another place would be \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 the expectation of it irrational. that which is needful to ballast a great \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 will sink a small boat. if a considerable number of antipaedobaptists should as our fathers here did obtain liberty from the state to transport themselves and families into a wast american wilderness that so they might be a peculiar people by themselves practising all and only the institutions of christ if now \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 baptists should come after them and intrude themselves upon them and \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 they cast men out of their society for moral scandals entertain them \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 they would desire such persons either to walk orderly with them or to return to the place from whence they came. and if they would do neither they would think that such paedo-baptists were blame-worthy let them then do as they would be done by and deal by us as they would have us to deal by them were they in our case and we in theirs. let them please to consider that those of their perswasion in this place have acted with so much irregularity and prophaneness that should men of any other perswasion whatsoever have done the like the same severity would have been used towards them. i truly profess unto them that if any men either of the presbyterian \\u2022\\u2022 congregational or never so much of my perswasion \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 matters referring to church-discipline should behave themselves as the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 in boston in new-england have done i think they would have deserved far greater punishment than any thing that to this day hath been inflicted upon them. whether the sentence passed on them by the churches proceeding in the name of the lord jesus were only the abuse of an holy ordinance or a \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 process according to scripture rule the following ammadversions \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 unto those that are willing to weigh matters impartially in the ballance of the sanctuary. how vain is it for men after they have received such excommunicates into their communion and them perceive that the world cries shame on them for it and some of their own perswasion reprove them in stead of abhorring themselves before god and the world and purging out the old \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 think they shall come off with saying it was a defect and who in this world \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 without their failings and then by retaining such in their communion to persist in their scandal to this very day to parallel the case of the anabaptists in newengland with that of the nonconformists in england seems most unreasonable. do the conforming congregations there cast men out of their fellowship for moral scandalous evils i doubt the godly discipline which their \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 confesseth was in the primitive church and should be in theirs is not found amongst them \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 should i believe the nonconformists would be loth to receive any such into their communion which the new-england anabaptists have done and have \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 therein from year to year and that after conviction \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 in their \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 narrative they seek to palliate this offence by \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 representation of things their iniquity is marked before the \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 and much so \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 will never wash them clean. if then dr. stillingfleet or \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 shall go about to stir up persecution against conscientious \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009  and endeavour to justifie it by the practice of congregational \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 in new-england we see not that any real advantage hath been \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009  only taken from proceedings here. the author of the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 called the mischief of impositions hath given a fair and \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 answer to the doctor as to this particular. they say those of the congregational way in england plead for anabaptists liberty as for their own. that they plead for liberty and indulgence to be extended towards those that differ from them only in that point of paedo-baptisme i believe when i was in england i did so my self and if i were their now i would do so again but that they should plead for liberty unto such practices as our anabaptists have been guilty of is not easie to believe or if they do it is because such narrators as these animadverted upon have by untrue relations misguided them into undue apprehensions. nay i am fully convinced that those of their own way if of serious and gracious spirits when once they are possessed with a true relation of things concerning them will see cause to condemn new-england less and those their friends more than at first they were aware of how did they bear the world in hand that the churches here did excommunicate them for nothing but their opinion in scrupling paedobaptisme but that therein they have dealt most untruely and injuriously the subsequent answer to their narrative hath made apparent from the church-records concerning those matters. finally let me intreat the brethren to believe that some of us would shew as much indulgence unto truly tender consciences as themselves. it is not so long since our own necks bled under an intolerable yoke of imposition upon conscience as that we should forget what it is to be so dealt with or exercise that severity towards any that we have our selves complained of in others. but the brethren will readily own that some men have pretended conscience when pride  perverseness in the will have been at the bottom they will also confess that a meer pretence of conscience is not enough to bear men out in an evil practice. all the difficulty is in discerning the one of these from the other. blessed mr. burroughs in his excellent irenicum hath laid down rules concerning this and if that which he saith pag. 32. be sound doctrine as undoubtedly it is some of our anabaptists have not such characters of a tender conscience upon them as were to be desired. if men will call \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 practices by the name of their opinion and when their \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 born witness against make out cries that they suffer for their opinion and for their conscience how is it \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 or those help them who desire to keep their own consciences pure and with out offence towards god by being faithful according to that capacity the lord hath set them in and giving a due testimony against \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 things which they believe provoke him to jealousie and if a \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 in this land have declared their agreement with those of \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 like perswasion in england as to matters of faith and worship \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 not but that there are many godly antipaedobaptists there \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 will never declare their agreement with those here as to their \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 practices which have been so offensive to christ and unto his people in new-england. boston new-engl. nov. 1681. increase mather. brief animadversions upon the new england anabaptists late narrative wherein the great mistakes by them published are made apparent. section there are two things which every one who designs to give the world an account of the history of things done ought principally to endeavour viz. truth of expressions with a plain and full recital of all essential passages thereto belonging. candor in animadverting charitably upon them not setting our malicious glosse upon things deserving a better interpretation which rules if the author of this narrative had in any degree observed this reply had been needless our present business is not to vindicate the doctrine and practise of these churches in point of infant baptisme which if the anabaptists judge not to have been already sufficiently performed we cannot help that but it being so that these churches in new-england are herein charged with persecution raised against that sort of men and both their and our management of affairs depending between them and us in that respect are grosly misrepresented and convincible of manifest falshoods of which they cannot be except willingly ignorant and should no answer be made the world might judge us truly charged as to matter of fact and on that account draw such conclusions as best sure their own apprehensions yea our best friends might possibly be prejudiced at us it was thought needful to prevent a second error by discovering the first. in such a case the wise mans counsel seems applicable prov. 26. concerning the author of this narrative divine providence \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 removed him from our endeavours of conviction and the laws \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 humanity as well as religion forbid us now to be over severe \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 our censures of him his everlasting estate is not my business to \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 quire after nor would i at all reflect upon him if an answer \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 have been made without it however it being john russel with \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 consent of the whole of whom they tell us he was an officer it \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 them therefore to stand by it as far as they can whom to \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 obnoxious and make known to the world so far as they \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 made it necessary to do it by this script of theirs is the professed designe of this reply and let the reader take notice that my controversie is with an historian in point of truth and falshood and not with a divine in matter of orthodoxy and error in which we hope the anabaptists will not be angry if we are as tender of our reputation as they were in printing of their pamphlet for the clearing of their innocency. sect. i shall begin with the title which promifeth fair and looks innocently but yet methinks might have done better to have spoken \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 and told us indeed what it intended. it is not fair to invite a man with a specious show and then cheat him he calls it a brief narrative and we promised our selves to find an honest toothless \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009  but upon reading it it seems more fit to be called a saty \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 invective for certainly the principal part of it is rather a \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 than a narrative or what if we call it a romance which according to the use of the word is a story built upon a real subject but adorned with fictions or a representation of things according as we saney they should be not regarding what they are indeed but let it be a narrative what is the business it hath to acquaint us with considerable passages. sometime the worth and excellency of a thing sometime the newness and strangeness of it render it considerable and sometimes it is very considerable whether the thing be so or no. but what is it that is so consiberable why \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 story of the first gathering and further progress of a church of christ in gospel order in boston in new england it is certainly considerable and admirable too that christ should have any church in gospel order in the world since satan and \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 are so busie so wast and overturn all order partly by secret conspiracies and open persecutions partly by seducing spirits and disorders of erroneous persons such as quakers anabaptists but through gods goodness there are more churches then one in gospel order in boston in engl. whereas that is rather an ubiquitarian church. but what church may this be which is so eminently observable oh it is a church commonly though falsly called by the \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009  and it is well that it is \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 else we should hardly have believed it a church in gospel \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009  because we know baptism is one of the foundations of gospel order heb. 1 but are they falsly so called alas for our ignorance we have mistaken the men all this while men render themselves suspected when they deny their names but they have but one baptism therefore not to be called anabaptists but to deal fairly by anabaptists we mean no other but those men that deny the baptism received in infancy to be any baptism and seek another pretended one of their own and thereby undermine the baptisme that hath been practised and owned by all the churches of christ in the world ever since christ excepting a few of their own sect and if the word be not so proper yet being generally used and well understood it pleads custome and may do better then a new one their own term baptists is fallacious insinuating that there are none for baptisme but themselves. next he tells us the moving cause of that narrative which is very honest and good it is for the cleaving of their innocency and that every good man may lawfully do and sometimes ought. the first fathers in the church wrote their apologies. but it were better to be innocent without a plea then to do mischief and then wipe their mouth and say i have done no wickedness. it was high time to purge themselves with a narrative when there were so many scandalous things laid to their charge but if either the things be not laid to their charge that part of their defence will be vain and superfluous or the things laid to their charge be both true and scandalous they will never be able to render them other then so by writing narratives. sect. in the next place we have an epistle to the reader to usher in the narrative dignam patelld operculum. if strangers will needlesly be medling they must thank themselves if they get a blow. they tell us they leave the ensuing apology to plead for it self but it had been friendly to have spoke a word for it it being able to speak to \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 for it self yet they are willing to give in their testimony \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 that one and the same spirit in christians makes them in passions and affections present though locally distant and extends a follow-feeling with the members of the same body and if that were proper to sincere christians or characteristical of them they had said something but experience lets us know that a spirit of error is as diffusive as that of sincerity and a common cause though bad can tye men up in a combination and conspiracie hence they do well to subjoyn that plea from their perfect agreement in matters of faith and worship for if so then self interest also obligeth them to take part with their brethren and they do it to purpose having squeezed the quintessence of the book into their epistle. the intendment of it is to accuse this government and these churches of persecuting the saints and servants of christ and they begin with the churches where wisely taking the question for granted which might have put them to some difficulty to have proved they endeavour to aggravate our guilt by divers arguments. our practises are contrary to the principles and practises of our \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 of the congregational way in england which do equally plead for the liberties of the anabaptists as their own but let them not be angry if we are hard to believe that those of the congregational way in england do judge such anabaptists as these in new-engl. to be as orthodox as themselves and deserve like countenance and favour or that magistrates and churches are no wayes bound to labour according to the power given them to suppress errors scandalously persisted in or to manifest a practical dislike of them is not this to scandalize the congregational churches there that they may better accuse them here our practises are contrary to the design of our first planters who left all for liberty of conscience and we are the children of those that felt the lash of imposition and yet will shew to others the like severity. i perceive they are mistaken in the design of our first planters whose business was not toleration but were professed enemies of it and could leave the world professing they died no \\u2022 libertines. their business was to settle and as much as in them lay secure religion to posterity according to that way which they believed was of god. if therefore this people parted with so much and were at such charges for their liberties why then do the anabaptists trouble them who had neither scot nor lot in that charge let them go and do the like and we shall not so molest their churches as they have shamefully done by ours. it is against their brethren the sincerity of the expression \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 much to be suspected since we know that they do deny us to be so much as visible christians while they declare our baptisme not only to be a mal administration but a meer nullity. but granting it we never could finde that discipline rightly administred was against christian charity and yet the subject of it is brethren yea the neglect of that duty in case would argue want of love if not hatred levit. 19. 17. but they are brethren that avowedly profess and appeal to the same rule but what if the churches in their bearing witness against them do appeal to the same rule and think they should violate it by neglecting this duty how shall we do then why do they censure our church censures against them that have sometimes been our members we do avowedly appeal to the same rule. is it sufficient to satisfie men in one anothers proceedings though contrary because they appeal to the same rule this must certainly be some lesbian rule that may square to all mens opinions and fancies. that the present molestation given them is meerly for a supposed error relating to the subject of baptisme here learn how dangerous a thing it is to take a thing for truth upon the credit of prejudiced persons. how untrue this is there will be afterward occasion in divers examples to make appear only we must give them leave to call it a supposed error but with whom with them it is a believed truth and of such weight that it were better set a fire on the world than not stand up in it's defence and i can assure them with us it is more than a supposed error and yet that that hath been the only ground of their being molested shall also appear to be more than a supposed falshood. it is a matter which hath been and if we believe them is still sub judice controverted and that between learned and judicious holy and good men why then should they be so stiffe for it or we against it it is very weak for men to be so rigid on all hands about a nice controversie and indeterminable question which learned and good men have not these 1600 years known how to determine. but upon search i finde it hath been both professed and defended in all ages by the churches of christ though this truth as many others hath not escaped the opposition of men left by god to a spirit of error but it hath fared as well as almost any great gospel truth god having ever raised up worthy patrons for the defence of it. if fundamental truths must be the more charily or dubiously \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 because men \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 with error and holding perverse principles yet pretending holiness and what \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 ever did other impugne it it would be a plausible way to subvert all. with these arguments they fortifie their conclusion viz. that \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 one protestant congregation on such occasions to persecute \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 where there is no pretense to infallibility in deciding controversies seem \\u2022 much more unreasonable then all the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 of the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 church before i saw this narrative one told me it was a moderate piece and shewed a christian spirit. if they intend us not in these words they are vain men if they do they render themselves the persecutors pursuing us with bitter words who have this to say that in all our dealings with them we have allowing humane infirmities walked by the golden rule they urge upon us if rightly understood doing as we would be done by. now they have a word of counsel to the governours in new-england to consider their brethren of the congregational way in england left they justifie those that trouble them there. they owe thanks to any that will fairly put them in mind of their duty only in this counsel there lurks a dangerous evil which in retaliation of courtesies they are to be admonished of viz. they forget that the cause evermore alters the quality of the action nor was it ever thought by any of a found minde that justice should not be administred upon offenders left others by misapplication should thence take occasion to wrong the innocent and the honourable governours in new-england have learned and are perswaded that if they should sin by omitting duty for mans sake they should both dishonour god and grieve their brethren. to scare us the more with this they tell us how dr. stilling. fleet improved it to the same purpose against us all i shall say to this is we cannot confess guilty for the censure of those who neither knowing what we do nor weighing the difference of cases which they would make parallels rashly conclude against us we humbly conceive men that are not prejudiced will easily discern that suppressing with all gentleness and tenderness a dangerous error and of bad tendency such as anabaptism especially so circumstanced as in newengland it hath been and the enforcing of ceremonies in religion which are neither directly nor by any good consequence required in or by the word of god do differ toto coelo. for the concluding prayer we can heartily put it up to god and might have joyned with them in it too had they not added it as a cloak to the slander of their epistle. sect. now follows the narrative it self in which the first thing that \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 us is indeed a brief account of their congregating or that \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 of theirs in gathering a church where we have the moving \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 the manner and the materials of it. the moving cause of it is brief and pithy it pleased god to \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 their hearts and if this be indeed so then those that opposed \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 in it and endeavoured to suppress them will be found fighters \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 against god and to act in vain for the will of god shall be accomplished and no weapon formed against it shall prosper and this argument we shall finde them making use of page but who knows not that all hereticks pretend to the spirit and direction of god though it's certain that in so doing they take the name of god in vain and it's little less then blasphemy to bring god in to patronize their sinful actions for god doth not graciously move the hearts of any to irregular and unlawful actions and though men are very prone to entitle him to it yet he utterly disclaims it jam. 13 14. and it is certain that when men grow wanton and despise the ordinances god many times judicially gives them strong delusion to believe a lye 2 thess. 10 11. and that is none of the least to misjudge a seducing spirit to be the spirit of god. to follow an erring conscience which verily believes his error to be the truth is not to follow the direction of the spirit of god. if what god forbids conscience perswades this is not of gods approbation for so he should be against himself. it is a snare and a judgement to be under such a conscience so that they must pardon us if we suspect the moving cause. the persons thus moved are described from their former experience of his teaching such whom by his word and spirit he had instructed and taught in the way. thus one error begets another what have we to do with the anabaptists kuria d\\xf3xa do none but the orthodox bring this plea we expected he should have given us some rules by which we might have known it. it is a piece of arregancy for men to beg the principle or forcibly impose upon our belief that which is the very dispute and controversie between us whither it be an error or no and they tell us god taught them therefore it is no error true but if we reply it is an error therefore god taught them not where are we now are anabaptists only masters of rules and canons may not we as easily deny as they affirm without proof they entred into solemn covenant to walk in communion in the practice of all the holy appointments of christ and so became \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 church of christ this alone will not make them a church of christ \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 for it so then every combination of enthusiasts ranters \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 may become churches of christ for they do pretend and promise each other in words as much as these or any other churches \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 the world can do but there are synagogues of satan too in \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 world. if they who are fit to be cast out of churches and are \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 actually combine and covenant doth that make them a church they are men of holy and exact walking viz. in the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 and performance of the holy ordinances of christ according to \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 institution if men were not proud and confident they would never impose their assertions upon us with an ipse dixit grant but an anabaptist that his opinion is true and he can easily prove that ours is false but if you question that he hath no more to say to you. it is certain they have exploded infant baptisme which hath been acknowledged by the body of the church christian in all ages not only for an institution but a principal institution of christ but if these deny it then we are mistaken. how like holy men they have walked will appear afterwards. he gives us the names of the men who laid this precious foundation and if they had been such men as had done this to begin right church order in new-england they ought not to be forgotten but had in honourable remembrance but if they were and i am afraid the great day will discover that they were the heads and ringleaders of a schisme and culpable cause of great troubles in the churches of christ in new-england they had better been forgotten. sect. and now we have a church gathered of such excellent materials and in so regular a way what reception is it they finde in new-england one would think that such a church and in such a place. should have been highly esteemed strenuously defended by the civil magistrate and imitated by all the churches who came into the wilderness on very purpose to serve god in his own way but unhappily missed of it till the anabaptists found it out but lo they meet the quite contrary they are assailed with troubles and afflictions and from whom certainly a vile generation but it must be born they \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 not the first sufferers for the truth nor for falshood neither it \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 alwayes befallen those whom god hath singled out from others to bear \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 to the truth true the world ever persecuted the church \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 have not the people of god also had their zeal to maintain the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 of god and counted it their duty to use means to suppress \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 as upon what pretence soever sought to pervert them and if \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 have proved his people with anabaptists as he is wont to do his \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 with seducers who shall blame them that have shown their \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 to god in endeavouring to stop their progress and thus the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 sufferings of these men will be a poor argument to prove them \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 servants of christ though men may be sufferers yet they are not presently martyrs causa non passio facit martyrem. but these precious saints acted by the right spirit of the old confessors had counted the cost and therefore chearfully past these pikes and are now gone to rest and it is pity to disturb them only it might not be amiss to remember that the vilest hereticks and grossest blasphemers have resolutely and cheerfully at least sullenly and boastingly suffered as well as the people of god histories are pregnant with examples and therefore hitherto they have said nothing to convince any one of their orthodoxy and sincerity they may be right they may be out of the way for all this. sect. we have now done with the narrative handsomely contrived in one page the other fourteen are apologetical which they were put upon for three reasons. to emblazon the names of their dead founders and prevent the worlds being mistaken in them and truly first founders deserve a record and they should be unworthy successors if they did not canonize them though as things are circumstanced some wise men think they had done them a kindness if they had said nothing and to me i am sure for then i had been prevented this undesired task of publishing the follies of men after they are dead. the childe doth his father the best kindness to say nothing of him when by speaking he doth but revive his infamy. but i take it for a just judgement of god on that generation of men that by a fallacious narrative they should enforce us to make the world acquainted with the scandalous conversation of these beginners which had otherwise slept in the private records of those churches wherein they were acted. the very grievous scandals cast upon these beginners \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 men if incorrigible deserve to have scandals cast upon \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 and if we shall prove these such they must for ought i know \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 the reproach of it and thank themselves. but yet there are two things wherein they are to be blamed \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 lay scandal to them though just yet it is unjustly done. viz. the frame of spirit they do it with they are rugged \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 truly this becomes not men who profess a spirit of meekness \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 yet sometimes the gospel calls christians to withstand seducers \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 the face to characterize some men in their proper colours and \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 earnestly with them for the truth yea experience tells us \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 such a rough thing as a new-england anabaptist is not to be handle ever tenderly the spirit which they have at all times discovered under the greatest disadvantages and god grant that they may never have more advantage over us easily tells us what they would have been if circumstanced as those whom they accuse. a wicked end and a good action may be spoiled by a bad design at bottom we have charged them on purpose to make them odious and make the world believe them a people not fit to live men wonderfully sagacious and extreamly charitable i dare say none of ours ever told them this was thier end why might they not have interpreted it zeal paul so interpreted his persecuting country-men. but suppose it be made appear that we have not endeavoured to render their persons odious but only their perverse doctrine and that we have used all meekness patience gentleness towards men in that capacity we took them to be in for any such passage of any of ours as judging them not fit to live i know not of it nor i believe do they nor do we patronize any such expression though since their book hath so many in it i know not why this may not go for one of their mistakes and now they appeal to god we accept it readily. sect. their great sufferings are of two forts. in estate and liberties of which we must not expect a particular account  are charitably to think it is because they are tender of our reputation but errorsly in generals a particular account might have been more satisfying. these things look directly upon our magistracy in vindication of them a word will suffice. two things take up this discourse the persecution and the success. the persecution is compendiously represented. some of \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 were oftentimes brought before councils i suppose they allude to mat. 10. 17. to which let this be taken as a reply viz. that as the honoured magistrates here are christian so have they judged it their duty to maintain the ways of christ and strengthen them by civil laws which hath not only been the practice of reformers of old but the constant judgement of the church of christ ever since the apostles. if evil minded men will take this advantage to oppress the truth it is no more then may be done in all other cases  as it is thought no good plea to keep the scriptures from the laity lest they should learn to be hereticks so neither to deny the magistrate his due power on supposition that he may abuse it. on this principle our worthy rulers have made laws against many sects and intruders and among the rest the anabaptists. that in quelling the anabaptists they do not oppose the truth but suppress error they are fully perswaded and although they never pretended to a lordship over mens consciences yet they account the outward man is subject to them and if we must tarry till all men are agreed about what is truth before we oppose error we shall stay till there is no need \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 . for the progress of our magistracy in the execution of these laws they have been so far from a violent eager or willing taking advantage against these men that notwithstanding their opprobrious speeches when they have been before them their scornful carriages and purposed indeavours to irritate them by insolent challenges they have alwayes proceeded slowly tenderly far on this side the law as those who sought not to ruine either their names liberties or estates. how often when fines have been laid upon them have they stopt the execution if any have been imprisoned it hath been but when dared to it and though once a sentence of banishment did pass upon two of their ring-leaders heady violent men yet then they neglected and scorned to take notice of it resolving to run utmost hazards neither was this improved as any advantage against them. nor is it to be wondred that our governours have been opposite in particular to these men since if they could get head among us they would certainly undermine the churches ruine order destroy piety and introduce prophaness. for the success of these endeavours god is pleased still to uphold them and they are by these means not weakened but strengthened and increased methinks i hear the jews crying we are delivered to do \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 these abominations. let them but remember that many things are done by gods permissive providence when the doers have not his approbation nor is it an unfailing ground of sincerity that they have withstood such trials and are increased we know do what we can to restrain them evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse and many shall follow their pernicious wayes. nor is it to be wondred at that persons discontent with the yoke of christ in the churches or taking offence at particular administrations which might touch their own interest have so readily followed the faction of the anabaptists of which sort of men the most of their society and founders here have consisted. sect. their great sufferings in their name and it should seem there are many terms of reproach cast upon them pardon them then if they are very tender of their reputation. only they should have gone orderly to work first to have got a good name and then to have kept it by walking worthy of it. here we have a file of scandalous things laid to their charge they might have done well to have told us where and by whom that we might have compared them but i see we must do what we can and consider what is charged and how justly and whither they are wipe i away in their defense. these are no fewer then eight let us examine them. they are a schismatical company who have rent themselves from the churches of christ and received into their society such as have disorderly left the churches. ans. this charge in termes was never made against them by us and so part of their vindication is superfluous for we never said all of them rent from these churches some were strangers to us till their trubulency made them too well known and others were never joyned to other churches but had lived without communion. but that they are a society of schismaticks if schisme be an unjust renting from a church of christ we assert. three things they in words grant. that our churches are churches of christ page 14. that some of them were once members of them page that some of theirs did depart from these churches and joyn in this new combination page now to prove them hence a company of schismaticks observe that whosoever combine with and encourage schismaticks have fellowship with them in their sin. that thomas gold and thomas osborn the persons in dispute were schismaticks or did unjustly rend from the church where they were before members will appear by a true relation of matters of fact for this story of the narrative and truth are strangers whereof there is sufficient testimony to be found in the records of the church at charlstown whereof they were members and there are many faithful witnesses yet alive who were present at these transactions and can say if these things be not so which ought to outweigh the story of a prejudiced person who hath all by hearsay whose very business is to palliate and lick over matters to shape them to his own turn here for goodman gold let the reader consider these things and let the anabaptists disprove them if they can. that though he was first called to an account about withholding his childe from baptisme yet that was not the reason of his being admonished as the pamphlet asserts nor because he could not be convinced of error not yet did the church proceed to admonition till such time as he not only spake contemptuously and irreligiously of the emptiness  nullity of that ordinance but also used unbecoming gestures in the time of administration of which being asked the reason he before the congregation acknowledged they were to cast disresect upon it nor then neither till after much patience. now let anabaptists themselves judge whither there be not a vast difference between doubting about an ordinance and professedly vilifying of it by unhandsome words and carriages and whither they will bear with any member of theirs that will so contemn any of those things which are to them sacred and acknowledged as christs institutions. 2 that at his first admonition he was not sententially suspended but only desired for the preventing of the offence of some to abstain from coming to the other sacrament. that upon this thomas gold took up a trade of absenting himself from the meetings of the church to worship god on the sabbath which made a new offence. that the church in much tenderness waited upon him and after many provocations proceeded not to excommunication but tried with admonition upon admonition and that by the space of seven or eight years nor was he excommunicated till \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 having left his own. he joyned to another society without the churches leave or once asking it and now also being twice sent for by the church \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 their authority over him. that thomas gold did not leave the church at charlstown on the account of the anabaptists new church as is pretended but had many years before renounced his submission to that church. that he did while under admonition neglect publick worship and gather a private meeting on the sabbath to his house. that he did contrary to the judgement of anabaptists themselves wickedly slight the admonition of the church declaring that they had by it discharged him of all relation to them. for thomas osborne the churches proceedings with him were with the like patience as to thomas gold only it is to be observed that his first offence which this dissembling pamphlet finding it disadvantagious wilfully passeth over was this whereas it is one thing which church-members engage to upon admission to walk with the church in constant attendance upon publick worship he without notifying any offence did withdraw and separate frequenting those schismatick meetings at golds on the sabbath this was the offence where was the narrators conscience mean while nor did he when first dealt with pretend any disl \\u2022 ke of infant baptisme but that the church gave no liberty to private brethren to prophesie that they limited the ministry to learned men and \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 he did not find his own spirit free to come though afterwards he \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 both of that and of their severity to the quakers though that church medled not with them but only to preach against their errors. in this practice he contumaciously persisted many years denying himself to be subject to that church or bound to assemble with them though he had solemnly given himself up to them in covenant slighting many admonitions and afterwards with thomas gold went off to and became a worthy pillar of an anabaptist church. and whereas he insists so upon a bitter spirit in the church against dissenters let seven years patience with serious endeavours in all tenderness to reclaim them speak whither it be not an audacious slander. and now reader judge are these a church of schismaticks or no sect. that we are scandalous in three respects. the foundation was laid with excommunicate persons. we called such to administer holy things who were justly for scandal cast out of \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 churches. for receiving such into our society. ans.. this is indeed the charge from the just imputation \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 all their tergiversations excuses suppressions of the truth and suggestions of falshood shall never acquit them. i find not that he denies the first proposition viz. that those who do such things adding the word justly to the first part of the charge are to be reputed scandalous. that they have so done remains to be proved. their foundation was laid with persons excommunicated and that for scandal for this it may be considered. thomas gold was not admonished for his opinion nor doth it appear that ever he should if he had carried humbly but for opprobrious words and carriages against an ordinance. which he himself had before professedly reverenced and highly esteemed and which he knew that church he walked with had still in the like esteem. and thomas osborne by relinquishing publick worship directly violated his covenant not so much as pretending at first any doubt about infant baptisme. they both of them despised the church continued to absent themselves laid false charges against them separated in a private meeting went off to the anabaptists without asking leave and so became supposed members of one before they were regularly discharged of their obligation to another church all which things are against the anabaptists own professed rules if they will stand to their confession. whereas he faith their not hearing the church was nothing else but their not coming when the church sent for them it is a foolish pretence their not hearing the church was their appearing and proving themselves impenitent and that after many treaties used with them many solemn admonitions laid upon them convictions sufficiently offered of sins against the light of their consciences and which it's certain they would have acknowledged had it not been for fear of being reconciled to the church whose excommunication they feared not but impudently des \\u2022 red. the truth is they were weary of their church relation and resolved to get rid of it and not knowing any regular way to obtain it they chose to sin rather then suffer and undergo a just excommunication that they might be by themselves presuming that they could blind the world with a vain pretense that they were ejected for no other reason but because they questioned the right of infant baptisme. hence thomas gold did particularly express before the church his desire to be excommunicated which yet they proceeded not to till by a first and second refusal to appear at the churches citing of them they proved themselves incorrigible. besides it is to be observed that these men having privately exercised their gifts in meetings with applause began to think themselves wronged that their light was put under a bushel and finding no remedy in our churches threw on a cloak of anabaptisme and so gained the thing they aimed at in a disguise. they called such to administer against all his winding to get clear of this only say thomas gold was thus imployed concerning whom too much hath been said except we had better to say. they have received such as have justly for moral evils been cast out of other churches adde and never given christian satisfaction. here he endeavours a salvo. the persons instanced are thomas foster and john farnham the former sometimes of the church as billerica. the other of the second gathered church in boston. he acknowledgeth they have received them but on just reasons or at worst not very irregularly. let the records of these churches be compared with this narrative and see if the anabaptists have not good skill in painting and putting a fair face on a foul matter. for thomas foster let it be observed. that he was not only a member of the church of billerica but of the foundation and at their gathering was full free and forward in owning infant baptisme to be as ordinance of christs institution and if he judged himself that notwithstanding to have been then a true christian he ought to have extended more charity then his after expressions shewed to the church still remaining of the same perswasion. that he first discovered his receding from that formerly received judgement by disorderly carriage at the time of administration of that ordinance and being reproved for it he confessed he had carried unbecoming any person in any christian assembly which gave satisfaction to the church. though when about three months after this he began and thence continued to leave the meeting at the celebration of baptism he was at a private church meeting given to understand that it grieved the brethren and that he had receded from his covenant and was advised solemnly and seriously to consider of it yet he was not as the narrator asserts laid under admonition or prohibited communion nor did the church ever do any such thing in private to any which he knew nor did they intend for this to have debarred him of communion. that after this he neglected the church assemblies and frequented the anabaptist meetings and was there rebaptized and being called by the church at a meeting at the pastors house to give an account of these proceedings though at first he dissembled yet at length acknowledged and justified his actions if false charges may be accounted a justification for he told them that they had laid him under sin whereas he thought he had not \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 amiss but they had not so done judicially though they told him \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 carriage was a grief to his brethren nor as i have said before \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 intended it so far is the narration from speaking truth when it \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 nothing but matter of conscience was or could be laid to his charge. that they denied him baptisme whereas they owned him for baptized and if he was not it was wickedness in him an unbaptized person to come to the lords table. that they yoked him with unbelievers which was because they extended church watch to a child or children of the church and yet for this he judged his separation lawful and produced for it 2 cor. 14 15 17. therein implicitly at least pronouncing the church a company of belialists and infidels. that they had presented him to the court the truth is one of the brethren of the church had made complaint of him to the grand-jury which occasioned his presentment judging his freemans oath engaged him so to do when other due means to reclaim him from his turbulent carriages had been used and this he makes the churches fault because they did not lay that brother under a censure for not daring to violate his oath and betray his fidelity to the civil authority. that they had dealt injuriously by one of his brethren in laying him under admonition in justification of which act there needs no account be given here only let any judge whither it be a just ground to separate from a church because i am not fully of their mind in every act of administration and also it seems a thing not warrantable for a private member of a church in pretence of selfvindication to vilifie and asperse a church of christ if this be humility what is pride but yet the church still continued to labour his conviction and when they could not obtain it after much patience they called him forth in publick charged him with offensive departing and rending away from the church denying himself a subject of discipline and vilifying the church by \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 charges he observing on ready to write his answer refused to speak any thing unless he were forbidden and not obteining it essayed to depart yea though required by the officer to stay and hear the church he wilfully withdrew on the following sabbath he was for these carriages admonished and debarred communion and not till then and after some patience used being called forth again to see if it repented him he remained obstinate and was therefore excommunicated and now compare notes and see what will become of john russel's consectaries as for his retaining the respect of a very godly man where he is known which is so boasted of it must be only among men void of reason for though we will not say but he may have the root in him yet he hath blasted profession by wicked wayes impenitently persisted in and thereby wounded such mens charity who judge as they ought of the tree by the fruit. sect. relating to john farnum we have him confessing guilty in some things acknowledging a defect but would not have it thought wilful nor such as any church in their imperfection may not easily fall into well they can make great faults little and small ones none at all. in sober earnest we may say of this act of theirs about farnum that if in nothing else they had been guilty yet that is enough to render them low in the hearts of any good men and a shame to anabaptists themselves. a little in so dirty a matter is enough to be said therefore they say when he walked in fellowship with the church he was in reputation among them for a very godly man. they should have left the word very out though in charity they had hopes he might have the root of the matter in him yet he was never judged eminent for his piety it was long ere he could obtain admission into the church at dorchester  some discerning christians ever suspected him to be john farnum such an one as he after proved. that he was deputed by them for a deacon and yet neither the present teacher nor any that have been added to the church these twenty years either deputed or thought him fit for that office and whereas there is but one surviving of the founders of that church he professeth there is never a syllable of truth in that report. that the churches \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 was \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 upon account of his opinion. the rugged spirit in these men against \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009  was the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 his withdrawing. other things were gathered to this having a face of scandal. a true survey of the churches proceedings will shew the vanity of these assertions for the church did not so much as deal with him till he had wholly withdrawn communion from them refusing so much as to hear the word preached with them for many months no nor so much as declared themselves offended with him. what now is this rugged spirit when he alledged his opinion the teacher of the church though possibly some may think he did more than the rule required declared to him that if he were so weak as not to think it lawful to see a child baptized his withdrawing when that ordinance was administered should not be imputed as an offence how is it then that his judgement was the principal thing in that process his offence for which he was dealt with was many moral evils and so a complicate offence breaking forth at once viz. renouncing communion with the church contrary to heb. 10. 24. holding familiarity with excommunicate persons contrary to math. 18 17. thess. 6 14. slanders against several holy and worthy men now with christ. that having been often reproved for these things he still persisted. when the elders reproved him for these slanders he replied that they might be offended at a thousand things he cared not and that there was never an elder in newengland was willing any should read the scripture but themselves after this he was called before the church tenderly dealt with and those scripture rules which he had transgressed were applied to his conscience but in vain. at the third church meeting on his account octob. 16. 1665. the pastor mr. mayo told him it wos expected that after so much patience he should manifest repentance. his reply was that he desired none of their patience he was humbled for his sins. the teacher mr. mather saying to him we must see it by the fruits he retorted you see it you shall never see it some brethren told him his speeches and carriage were very sinful they had never seen the like be replied i did not come hither to be \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 and \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 at by every one and so he turned his back to depart the pastor wished him to stay and hear what further they had to say and seeing him still proceed charged him in the name of the church and of christ to stay he rejoyned \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 christ to me i am not out that can how and stoop \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009   exit. the same day he told some of the brethren that he wished the church would excommunicate him and then he should be of a better society. on all these accounts was he laid under admonition. two months after which being called before the church he in words confest the evil of some of the particulars but was observed at the same time to turn about and laugh where then was his repentance the church this notwithstanding waited divers months longer till he went on to that height of impiety and prophaneness that one of the teaching officers setting before the church the rule concerning excommunication farnum makes a leg to him in the assembly in way of derision and declared that except the church would yield to four things he would have no communion with them viz. they must set up the ordinance of \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 . promise to baptize no more infants. all be baptized rebaptized themselves. put away their present and still continuing teacher from his office. upon these things the church concluded upon his censure only allowing him another months patience after which no repentance appearing they proceeded. now judge whither these things have no more than a face of scandal and that too only as they are taken and construed. whither their admission of him were not more than a meer defect in those who so admitted him yea a meer scandal stinking in the no \\u2022 thrils of moral men. whither if it were but a defect it were not a wilful one since they either had or might have had an account of the churches proceedings with him and ought to have inquired after the true cause of his excommunication before they received him. well it was but a little fault and a little amendment was enough and what was that when clamors were revived and renewed and then to speak of open and notorious wickedness if it be approved by a society of an baptists is clamour. but it's well a clamour roused them whom serious warnings and informations could not. and now the church in good time are dissatisfied and determine to make search but they knew before that he was excommunicated only because he was an anabaptist they concluded it was for his opinion we see what harm too much credulity doth men. now they send messengers procure a copy of proceedings and are convinced better late then never suspend him bring him to give them satisfaction advise him to satisfie the church he had offended patcht cobling work a good shoe-maker would have scorn'd it. who appointed the anabaptist church to be a \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 court of \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 to judge cases for and receive satisfaction on the account of \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 church in respect of any of their members ex \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 this teacheth us what lordly men they would be had they advantage. but he did apply himself to that church and all were well satisfied but one how did goodman russel know this suppose all but one remained dissatisfied nay what if not so much as one was well satisfied where are we then except he know them better then they know themselves both the elder and brethren utterly deny the truth \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 this passage it is true indeed he did once and again in \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 acknowledge that the church had exercised patience towards him and that he had been guilty of sin and great evil both in word and action and orally before the church he confessed he had done very wickedly and was ashamed of himself the church then had done well. but why is he not then upon this restored alas this he sought not but the very next day declared that if he should return into communion with that church it would be the greatest sin that ever he had been guilty of in his life which made the brethren suspect his confession to be insyncere and yet this satisfies the anabaptists they still continue to hold communion with a vile person justly cast out not seeing to be restored and therefore by the will of christ to be counted and carried to as an heathen and a publican. sect. that we are disorderly and walk disorderly. for all his \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 excuse and abuse of scripture in it there needs no more but to consider whither it be not to walk disorderly to receive into their communion persons that are under church dealing for moral evils yea excommunicate impenitents and not to withdraw from them after they have confessed they missed it in so doing. if this be not disorder to set up a church for a sanctuary or city of refuge for scandalous men who scorning to submit to the discipline of christ presently take up anabaptisme and know where to be made welcome we may then enquire whither there be any such thing as disorder. sect. we are disturbers of the publick p \\u2022 ace that this hath \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009  been charged upon them i find not but that they have made disturbance among us is true what else have been the \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 of some now theirs when of other churches with the courses they have taken to make parties what their many complaints into england and misrepresentations of us to render us as obnoxious as might be and what this narrative sect. that we are under miners of the churches and is not this true neither alas that in all things we should so mistake but this we mean that such of these men as sometimes stood in relation to other churches fought to draw others away with them witness thomas gol \\u2022 's private meeting in his own house for many years where living two miles distant from the publick place of worship their neighbours i speak things known were drawn in and there were the churches \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 and ministers scoffed at and means used to alienate mens hearts and not only so but they have published to the world that infant baptisme is a nullity that we are churches of unbaptized men and women and have unbaptized officers by these pleas seeking to draw men off and if this be their reduction it is in vain distinguished from destruction and is properly seduction. adde to this their readiness to receive any discontented persons so that if any be under offence in any of our churches though he be never so vile let him but turn anabaptist they will take up his case if he can satisfie them and we may think a little will do let his own seek it where they can get \\u2022  is not this undermining nay have they not by that unjust \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009  and false reports done more hurt to the churches of christ in new-england than all their enemies in the world besides sect. we neglect publick worship on the lords day what he brings are for justification is to us a confessing guilty that is it we mean and therefore what we say is not utterly untrue only the reasons \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 give for their separation are misrepresented. whereas they \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 mould not admit any of them to communion with us they know \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 our churches have received some that were scrupulous about \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 baptisme who were willing to carry inoffensively that we have \\u2022 used such as were rebaptized among these excommunicate ana \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 is true by \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 viz. except they would acknowledge \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 repent of that act because we judge it scandalous. and \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 the world we have been shut out of our publick house and \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 nailed up and we forced to meet without in the open air on a \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 old day he seems to have forfeited all honestly so to relate it is true the civil authority here have by a \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009  prohibited any from erecting any publick meeting house \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 the consent of the freemen of the town where they live first orderly had and obtained at a publick meeting assembled for that end and license of the county court without such a law many hopeful plantations would have come to nothing. and it equally concerned all others with anabaptists and yet these men neglecting this law undertake such a business. report of this is made to the civil magistrate who enquired into it and these fallaciously pretend it might be for a warehouse or a brew-house that they still proceed till it become a meeting house and is met in on the lords dayes now are they again called before the council justly reproved for slighting the law and for dissimulation and lovingly desired to be content to meet in private as before till the general court near approaching might hear and determine this matter. they refusing to promise so to do. order was given to nail up their doors whereupon the anabaptists sullenly meet in the open air on a cold day though a large house and their usual place of meeting stood just by that they might make matter to frame a scandalous clamour out of yet were the doors soon broken open again and they there publickly meet before the court. now only desire to be satisfied who gave these men leave to trample all authority under foot and live as men that are lawless sect. that we are idolaters for this they quote the late synod-book but there is no such word there we have not been afraid to charge them with the breach of the second commandment. every declining from the rules of worship omission or alteration of divine institutions without immediate warrant from the law giver is against that command. sect. we are charged to be enemies of civil government. i find no such charge the first germane anabaptists were so we hope these though they have shown too much contempt of authority are not so far gone. but for his so gloriously \\u2022\\u2022 blazoning their service in the late wars it is neither to the purpose nor of much moment. that they did joyn against the common enemy is true swanzy a place chiefly consisting of anabaptists and where they had a church was the place where the enemy made the first onset which church \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 being one of two was as much removed as our four of above forty they so \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 upbraid us with page 15. besides \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 would fight rather than have his throat cut it was not for religion nor civil government but for lives and estates. for captain turner we have not abridged him ought of his due acknowledgement in what hath been published. but for his acts at connecticut falls they are hyperbolically discribed for there was another captain and his company joyned with him in that undertaking a man of appoved valour and conduct which at that time he discover \\u2022\\u2022 \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 prudent drawing off his men. captain turner was at that time by sickness disabled from doing much. 3 god saw meet to obscure the victory by the affrighted and disorderly retreat of our men the slaughter of many and death of captain turner. nor did the indians receive the greatest blow at that time nor is it the anabaptists true but vain glory to set such an encomium upon their own deeds. sect. we have dismissed the charge now comes a strong argument of their orthodoxy a witness from heaven viz. their happy preservation in the \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 of the small pox let it be remembred that one of their perswasion did of it at woborn where john russel lived and should have observed it and many of their children. but be it so their society is small and scattered from dan to beersheba. and who knows but god might spare them in judgement to harden them these things are too high for us only when god comes to chasten his people those that are not chastened may ask whither they are no bastards. sect. and now he had done had not a book of mr. mather's come out to which he hath a few words to say and a few he thinks are enough to confute so weak and silly a piece it is titled the divine right of infant baptisme ans. sooner said then proved. excellently refuted but he hath a word more in general and one or two in particular to say to it. in general any sober unbyassed christian may be satisfied that the main or one main design of it is to render all that are nicknamed anabaptists as odious as he could i am sorry for it that so good a look should have so bad a design but he is no unbyassed christian who asserts it and it is strange that that worthy man whose charity hath been so large to such men as is well known should be thus guilty and if he be truly it is very unhappy. but divers that have \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 the book cannot spy it i fear it is a suspicious \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 censorious slander. for his arguments it's answered they are no new ones and i like them the better verissimum est antiquissimum had he brought novel pleas i had suspected him as i do for that reason the anabaptists nay he tells us page he intends old arguments and no other. but what then they must have no new answer being sufficiently confuted already. i am glad of that he saves me some labour by it. he blames him not for disputing for what he believes nor i neither but think he deserves commendation and god hath blessed it to the reclaiming of several that way inclined and settling many more in the truth. but why should mr. mather wickedly injure holy men by arguing an opinion must needs he bad because the professors of it have miscarried. but mr. mather hath expresly declared against any such conclusion. page 25. this is the sum of his argument. that opinion which hath been attended with signal judgements on the first and chief assertors of it and generality of those that have especially at first embraced it is to be suspected as erroneous. and is it any harm for men to suspect themselves when god seems to frown on them do not the anabaptists allow this argument and therefore plead that god kept and increased them under persecution page 2 and wonderfully preserved them in times of sickness page 12. which they desire may be observed though this is of little weight because these are not the first nor the chief. and do not the generality of the orthodox improve this argument against hereticks doth not john russel use it against us page 15. what besel corinthus manicheus arius dr. beards theater of gods judgements mr. clarks examples and others may speak for this. nay was it not thus with korah with ananias and saphira and for gods judicially leaving them to scandalous evils. see mat. 15 16. tim. 13. and what befel the first anabaptists see sleidan's commentaries and other authors of great note quoted by mr. mather. sect. but there is a thing or two in particular which he \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 pass they touch him so near. mr mather chargeth them with the sin of jeroboam but they are not concerned in or with it. the text alluded to is i kings 12.3 the original is jeroboam made priests of the extremities of the people both ends comprehend the whole see \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 in ezek. 33. it was \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 sin that any that would might under him be made priest fit or unfit. the belgick and others read it of both ends of the people. if a fit man would accept it so if not to the other end and take one unfit. the anabaptists would have a learned man if they could get one of their mind if not john russel the shoemaker. the learned zepperus. depolit. eccl. 186. lamenting the low and miserable estate of religion gives this for one reason of it they make ministres de \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 populist sartoribus sutoribus idiotis he doth not think the spirit is locked up in the narrow limits of colledge learning. nor we neither nor yet ministerial gifts to be ordinarily acquired in a shoemakers shop. we believe men are to be instructed and endeavours used and that there are schools of the prophets to that end or there may be private means used. we believe a learned man may prove  tious and so not fit to improved in that work. we believe every true christian receives the spirit in his measure but that he therefore is fit to teach and instruct a congregation is an enthusiastical notion. truly if goodman russel was a fit man for a minister we have but fooled our selves in building colledges and instructing our children in learning. frange leves calamos  scinde thalia sebellos si dare sutori calceus ista potest. mart. we have enough of his last to people new-england with prophets. sect. one thing more and he will dismiss us mr. mather chargeth them with a pernicious principle in their confession of faith viz. that believers baptized are visible christians and fit matter for a visible church. how may the altering of a word or two change the sence the words of their confession are believers being baptized are visible saints and true matter of a visible church. hence if the anabaptists would give leave to draw consequences but then they would never have done with us and that is the reason they cannot receive our arguments for infant baptisme because they are nothing but a few consequences and that is nothing to the purpose a man might argue that believers being unbaptized are not visible saints  we know they acknowledge none baptized but themselves and that will bring in another consequence that there are no visible saints but anabaptists but suppose a man cannot reach them a blow with a consequence let them yet say is baptisme administred to persons within the visible church or without it besides they say baptized persons are true matter of a visible church \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 were only sprinkled in their infancy were never baptized \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 not this undermine the foundation of all the churches in the \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 but theirs and what more pernicious they had even as good \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 with edom' sons raze it raze it to the foundation. and now he cannot chuse but burst out into a lamentation over such a spirit but thus it will be in the world that the joy of some will be made the grief of others the triumph of \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 will be the mourning of error i pray god this cause of the \\u3008\\u2026\\u3009 may be continued by the constant supply \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 men zealous against errors. sect. for a conclusion the narrator turns prophet  gets up to the top of mount ebal and there curses the people of god or these churches in new-england and what is it so stirs his splene why they have born their witness faithfully against anabaptists errors and scandals and detected the sin of those men who after they have for lyes' slanders covenant breaking despising gods ministers and slighting the admonitions of their respective churches been in christs name delivered up to satan have joyned themselves in erecting and establishing in anti-temple and like the samaritans of old become a mount gerizzim a den and receptacle for every mal-content and scandalous person that cannot submit to the discipline of christ in his churches to repair unto. and now for this they are compared to those damnable hypocrites mentioned mat. 24. 49. and threatned with no less then eternal desolation. we see what men may come to in time \\u3008\\u25ca\\u3009 with falshoods and end with cursings. but causeless curses shall not come nor need these churches regard if they keep faithful to their god though anabaptists anathematize them. \""

       "u\" ne sutor ultra crepidam. or brief animadversions upon the new-england anabaptists late fallacious narrative wherein the notorious mistakes and falshoods by them published are detected. by samuel willard teacher of a church in boston in new-england. prov. 18. 17. he that is first in his own cause seemeth just but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. rom. 16. 17. now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them. 18. for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. boston in new-england printed by green upon assignment of sewall. and are to be sold by philips at the west end of the exchange 1681. to the reader. the anabaptists in new-england have in their narrative lately published endeavoured to make candida de de themselves the innocent person and the lords servants no better than persecutors. in which respect it hath been necessary that some one should upon what they done that so such persons as have been by their untrue relation may be disabused. many are of the it is not worth the while to take notice of what by men so obscure and inconsiderable. and i i have though self so far as i am personally concerned in any of their reflections shall lose precious time in a needless desence. furore ego contemptu  vincit in christ. it seems to me that the reverend author of the following versions hath shewed much humility in condescending to take persons in hand between whom and himself there is such an impar congressus and let it be that for this once. he hath contradicted that proverbial saying aquils non capit muse as had he not been sensible that by good words and fair speeches the hearts of the are deceived this pains would have been spared. i verily believe that the baptists by their fallacious narrative have grievously offended god the things by them misrepresented were not done a far off for then mistakes about them would have been excusable but at home where right information was easie to have been obtained had they been willing to have others should have known the truth. and by this means have they done ill themselves forcing others to discover the enormities of some whose and shame should not have been divulged to the world and to posterity forever but slept in a grave of silence had not their own narrative brought them forth. they have also by letters misrepresented worthy and honourable persons as well as things and their reports have been received elsewhere with too much readiness and credulity as i perceive by certain complainants whosay they understand that the present honourable governour of this colony had threatned this poor people their christian friends as they stile them with death which report of theirs is like too many particulars in their vindication an utter quil . the governour whose integrity wisdome and is well known hath sometimes moved that an old severe law made against those that should manifest any publick contempt of that ordinance of infant might be lenifyed. so far is the scandalous report which they have raised upon the governour and caused it to fly three thousand miles from being true. as for the brethren that have thought good to prefix an epistle to such a narrative and there declare that molestation is given and severity is exercised towards england meerly for a supposed error about the subject of and holy men they are marvelously deceived in possibly i do not fully cape their meaning when they say protest and congregation to persecute another is more unreasonable then all of the church some are ready to take it for an intimation that churches of christ in new-england are more cruel and unreasonable than romish synagogue like as the anabaptists in germany looked upon such luther bullinger calvin zuinglius to be worse than the pope and his . but i hope they are far from any such insinuation and that they design no other then to suggest unto us that for men whom god hath by his holy spirit made one through faith in christ to be cruel to their brethren is most unreasonable. which assertion though true in thesi if applied to the churches of the lord jesus in this wilderness it is both an erroneous conception un just reflection protestants ought not to persecute any yet that protestants may punish protestants and as the case may be circumstanced a congregation of such as call themselves protestants cannot rationally be denied. those of the congregational way as themselves in the preface to their confession of faith have professed fully concurre with the old puritan non-conformists such as cartwright rainold whitaker bains parker in whose writings congregational principles about church government are to be seen. now the old notwithstanding their sufferings from those that took delight to fellowservants did believe that disorders in whole congregations were to the civil magistrates censure as is evident from that excellent and judicious called puritanismus anglicanus composed by mr. bradshaw and published by dr. ames. affirment si particular is aliqua ecclesia erraverit magistratus civilis in redigere cap. th. why then should we be rndred as men of rigid spirits and principles when we say nothing but what puritans worthy confessors and sufferers for the truth affirmed. our famous cotton was another moses in respect of meekness and christian forbeatance as to dissenters from his judgement in matters of a lesser concernment yet would he sometimes make a zealous protestation that if magistrates in new-england should tolerate transgressors against the rules of godliness as well as offences contrary to what the rules of honesty require he believed that god would not long tolerate them. and whereas the brethren that have the epistle pray the honourable governours in new-england to be careful of doing that which may give occasion of trouble to nonconformists elsewhere i shall heartily joyn with them in the same request and i can assure them that consideration hath caused more indulgence to be exercised towards their friends as they call them here than ever they were worthy of. and i it will be so still so far as may consist with scripture rules and the safety of the interest of christs kingdome in this wilderness. these churches are tender vines and i cannot perswade my self that the brethren when they rightly understand things will think that the magistrate should see little foxes spoiling them and should look on all the while as one no way concerned. as for those of the antipaedobaptistical perswasion which differ from us only in that particulars i would speak to them as unto brethren whom their error for so i believed is notwithstanding i love and would bear with and exercise the same indulgence and compassion towards them as i would have others to me who feel my self compassed with infirmities. i have been a poor labourer in the lords vineyard in this place upwards of twenty years and it is more than i know if in all that time any of those that infant- have met with molestation from the magistrate meerly on the account of their opinion. i would there others of their perswasion who may be of a christian and moderate-spirit have subscribed the epistle seriously to consider that the place may sometimes make a great alteration as to to be expected. it is evident that that toleration is in one place. not-only lawful but a necessary duty which in another place would be the expectation of it irrational. that which is needful to ballast a great will sink a small boat. if a considerable number of antipaedobaptists should as our fathers here did obtain liberty from the state to transport themselves and families into a wast american wilderness that so they might be a peculiar people by themselves practising all and only the institutions of christ if now baptists should come after them and intrude themselves upon them and they cast men out of their society for moral scandals entertain them they would desire such persons either to walk orderly with them or to return to the place from whence they came. and if they would do neither they would think that such paedo-baptists were blame-worthy let them then do as they would be done by and deal by us as they would have us to deal by them were they in our case and we in theirs. let them please to consider that those of their perswasion in this place have acted with so much irregularity and prophaneness that should men of any other perswasion whatsoever have done the like the same severity would have been used towards them. i truly profess unto them that if any men either of the presbyteriancongregational or never so much of my perswasion matters referring to church-discipline should behave themselves as the in boston in new-england have done i think they would have deserved far greater punishment than any thing that to this day hath been inflicted upon them. whether the sentence passed on them by the churches proceeding in the name of the lord jesus were only the abuse of an holy ordinance or a process according to scripture rule the following ammadversions unto those that are willing to weigh matters impartially in the ballance of the sanctuary. how vain is it for men after they have received such excommunicates into their communion and them perceive that the world cries shame on them for it and some of their own perswasion reprove them in stead of abhorring themselves before god and the world and purging out the old think they shall come off with saying it was a defect and who in this world without their failings and then by retaining such in their communion to persist in their scandal to this very day to parallel the case of the anabaptists in newengland with that of the nonconformists in england seems most unreasonable. do the conforming congregations there cast men out of their fellowship for moral scandalous evils i doubt the godly discipline which their confesseth was in the primitive church and should be in theirs is not found amongst them should i believe the nonconformists would be loth to receive any such into their communion which the new-england anabaptists have done and have therein from year to year and that after conviction in their narrative they seek to palliate this offence by representation of things their iniquity is marked before the and much so will never wash them clean. if then dr. stillingfleet or shall go about to stir up persecution against conscientious  and endeavour to justifie it by the practice of congregational in new-england we see not that any real advantage hath been only taken from proceedings here. the author of the called the mischief of impositions hath given a fair and answer to the doctor as to this particular. they say those of the congregational way in england plead for anabaptists liberty as for their own. that they plead for liberty and indulgence to be extended towards those that differ from them only in that point of paedo-baptisme i believe when i was in england i did so my self and if i were their now i would do so again but that they should plead for liberty unto such practices as our anabaptists have been guilty of is not easie to believe or if they do it is because such narrators as these animadverted upon have by untrue relations misguided them into undue apprehensions. nay i am fully convinced that those of their own way if of serious and gracious spirits when once they are possessed with a true relation of things concerning them will see cause to condemn new-england less and those their friends more than at first they were aware of how did they bear the world in hand that the churches here did excommunicate them for nothing but their opinion in scrupling paedobaptisme but that therein they have dealt most untruely and injuriously the subsequent answer to their narrative hath made apparent from the church-records concerning those matters. finally let me intreat the brethren to believe that some of us would shew as much indulgence unto truly tender consciences as themselves. it is not so long since our own necks bled under an intolerable yoke of imposition upon conscience as that we should forget what it is to be so dealt with or exercise that severity towards any that we have our selves complained of in others. but the brethren will readily own that some men have pretended conscience when pride  perverseness in the will have been at the bottom they will also confess that a meer pretence of conscience is not enough to bear men out in an evil practice. all the difficulty is in discerning the one of these from the other. blessed mr. burroughs in his excellent irenicum hath laid down rules concerning this and if that which he saith pag. 32. be sound doctrine as undoubtedly it is some of our anabaptists have not such characters of a tender conscience upon them as were to be desired. if men will call practices by the name of their opinion and when their born witness against make out cries that they suffer for their opinion and for their conscience how is it or those help them who desire to keep their own consciences pure and with out offence towards god by being faithful according to that capacity the lord hath set them in and giving a due testimony against things which they believe provoke him to jealousie and if a in this land have declared their agreement with those of like perswasion in england as to matters of faith and worship not but that there are many godly antipaedobaptists there will never declare their agreement with those here as to their practices which have been so offensive to christ and unto his people in new-england. boston new-engl. nov. 1681. increase mather. brief animadversions upon the new england anabaptists late narrative wherein the great mistakes by them published are made apparent. section there are two things which every one who designs to give the world an account of the history of things done ought principally to endeavour viz. truth of expressions with a plain and full recital of all essential passages thereto belonging. candor in animadverting charitably upon them not setting our malicious glosse upon things deserving a better interpretation which rules if the author of this narrative had in any degree observed this reply had been needless our present business is not to vindicate the doctrine and practise of these churches in point of infant baptisme which if the anabaptists judge not to have been already sufficiently performed we cannot help that but it being so that these churches in new-england are herein charged with persecution raised against that sort of men and both their and our management of affairs depending between them and us in that respect are grosly misrepresented and convincible of manifest falshoods of which they cannot be except willingly ignorant and should no answer be made the world might judge us truly charged as to matter of fact and on that account draw such conclusions as best sure their own apprehensions yea our best friends might possibly be prejudiced at us it was thought needful to prevent a second error by discovering the first. in such a case the wise mans counsel seems applicable prov. 26. concerning the author of this narrative divine providence removed him from our endeavours of conviction and the laws humanity as well as religion forbid us now to be over severe our censures of him his everlasting estate is not my business to quire after nor would i at all reflect upon him if an answer have been made without it however it being john russel with consent of the whole of whom they tell us he was an officer it them therefore to stand by it as far as they can whom to obnoxious and make known to the world so far as they made it necessary to do it by this script of theirs is the professed designe of this reply and let the reader take notice that my controversie is with an historian in point of truth and falshood and not with a divine in matter of orthodoxy and error in which we hope the anabaptists will not be angry if we are as tender of our reputation as they were in printing of their pamphlet for the clearing of their innocency. sect. i shall begin with the title which promifeth fair and looks innocently but yet methinks might have done better to have spoken and told us indeed what it intended. it is not fair to invite a man with a specious show and then cheat him he calls it a brief narrative and we promised our selves to find an honest toothless but upon reading it it seems more fit to be called a saty invective for certainly the principal part of it is rather a than a narrative or what if we call it a romance which according to the use of the word is a story built upon a real subject but adorned with fictions or a representation of things according as we saney they should be not regarding what they are indeed but let it be a narrative what is the business it hath to acquaint us with considerable passages. sometime the worth and excellency of a thing sometime the newness and strangeness of it render it considerable and sometimes it is very considerable whether the thing be so or no. but what is it that is so consiberable why story of the first gathering and further progress of a church of christ in gospel order in boston in new england it is certainly considerable and admirable too that christ should have any church in gospel order in the world since satan and are so busie so wast and overturn all order partly by secret conspiracies and open persecutions partly by seducing spirits and disorders of erroneous persons such as quakers anabaptists but through gods goodness there are more churches then one in gospel order in boston in engl. whereas that is rather an ubiquitarian church. but what church may this be which is so eminently observable oh it is a church commonly though falsly called by the and it is well that it is else we should hardly have believed it a church in gospel because we know baptism is one of the foundations of gospel order heb. 1 but are they falsly so called alas for our ignorance we have mistaken the men all this while men render themselves suspected when they deny their names but they have but one baptism therefore not to be called anabaptists but to deal fairly by anabaptists we mean no other but those men that deny the baptism received in infancy to be any baptism and seek another pretended one of their own and thereby undermine the baptisme that hath been practised and owned by all the churches of christ in the world ever since christ excepting a few of their own sect and if the word be not so proper yet being generally used and well understood it pleads custome and may do better then a new one their own term baptists is fallacious insinuating that there are none for baptisme but themselves. next he tells us the moving cause of that narrative which is very honest and good it is for the cleaving of their innocency and that every good man may lawfully do and sometimes ought. the first fathers in the church wrote their apologies. but it were better to be innocent without a plea then to do mischief and then wipe their mouth and say i have done no wickedness. it was high time to purge themselves with a narrative when there were so many scandalous things laid to their charge but if either the things be not laid to their charge that part of their defence will be vain and superfluous or the things laid to their charge be both true and scandalous they will never be able to render them other then so by writing narratives. sect. in the next place we have an epistle to the reader to usher in the narrative dignam patelld operculum. if strangers will needlesly be medling they must thank themselves if they get a blow. they tell us they leave the ensuing apology to plead for it self but it had been friendly to have spoke a word for it it being able to speak to for it self yet they are willing to give in their testimony that one and the same spirit in christians makes them in passions and affections present though locally distant and extends a follow-feeling with the members of the same body and if that were proper to sincere christians or characteristical of them they had said something but experience lets us know that a spirit of error is as diffusive as that of sincerity and a common cause though bad can tye men up in a combination and conspiracie hence they do well to subjoyn that plea from their perfect agreement in matters of faith and worship for if so then self interest also obligeth them to take part with their brethren and they do it to purpose having squeezed the quintessence of the book into their epistle. the intendment of it is to accuse this government and these churches of persecuting the saints and servants of christ and they begin with the churches where wisely taking the question for granted which might have put them to some difficulty to have proved they endeavour to aggravate our guilt by divers arguments. our practises are contrary to the principles and practises of our of the congregational way in england which do equally plead for the liberties of the anabaptists as their own but let them not be angry if we are hard to believe that those of the congregational way in england do judge such anabaptists as these in new-engl. to be as orthodox as themselves and deserve like countenance and favour or that magistrates and churches are no wayes bound to labour according to the power given them to suppress errors scandalously persisted in or to manifest a practical dislike of them is not this to scandalize the congregational churches there that they may better accuse them here our practises are contrary to the design of our first planters who left all for liberty of conscience and we are the children of those that felt the lash of imposition and yet will shew to others the like severity. i perceive they are mistaken in the design of our first planters whose business was not toleration but were professed enemies of it and could leave the world professing they died nolibertines. their business was to settle and as much as in them lay secure religion to posterity according to that way which they believed was of god. if therefore this people parted with so much and were at such charges for their liberties why then do the anabaptists trouble them who had neither scot nor lot in that charge let them go and do the like and we shall not so molest their churches as they have shamefully done by ours. it is against their brethren the sincerity of the expression much to be suspected since we know that they do deny us to be so much as visible christians while they declare our baptisme not only to be a mal administration but a meer nullity. but granting it we never could finde that discipline rightly administred was against christian charity and yet the subject of it is brethren yea the neglect of that duty in case would argue want of love if not hatred levit. 19. 17. but they are brethren that avowedly profess and appeal to the same rule but what if the churches in their bearing witness against them do appeal to the same rule and think they should violate it by neglecting this duty how shall we do then why do they censure our church censures against them that have sometimes been our members we do avowedly appeal to the same rule. is it sufficient to satisfie men in one anothers proceedings though contrary because they appeal to the same rule this must certainly be some lesbian rule that may square to all mens opinions and fancies. that the present molestation given them is meerly for a supposed error relating to the subject of baptisme here learn how dangerous a thing it is to take a thing for truth upon the credit of prejudiced persons. how untrue this is there will be afterward occasion in divers examples to make appear only we must give them leave to call it a supposed error but with whom with them it is a believed truth and of such weight that it were better set a fire on the world than not stand up in it's defence and i can assure them with us it is more than a supposed error and yet that that hath been the only ground of their being molested shall also appear to be more than a supposed falshood. it is a matter which hath been and if we believe them is still sub judice controverted and that between learned and judicious holy and good men why then should they be so stiffe for it or we against it it is very weak for men to be so rigid on all hands about a nice controversie and indeterminable question which learned and good men have not these 1600 years known how to determine. but upon search i finde it hath been both professed and defended in all ages by the churches of christ though this truth as many others hath not escaped the opposition of men left by god to a spirit of error but it hath fared as well as almost any great gospel truth god having ever raised up worthy patrons for the defence of it. if fundamental truths must be the more charily or dubiously because men with error and holding perverse principles yet pretending holiness and what ever did other impugne it it would be a plausible way to subvert all. with these arguments they fortifie their conclusion viz. that one protestant congregation on such occasions to persecute where there is no pretense to infallibility in deciding controversies seemmuch more unreasonable then all the of the church before i saw this narrative one told me it was a moderate piece and shewed a christian spirit. if they intend us not in these words they are vain men if they do they render themselves the persecutors pursuing us with bitter words who have this to say that in all our dealings with them we have allowing humane infirmities walked by the golden rule they urge upon us if rightly understood doing as we would be done by. now they have a word of counsel to the governours in new-england to consider their brethren of the congregational way in england left they justifie those that trouble them there. they owe thanks to any that will fairly put them in mind of their duty only in this counsel there lurks a dangerous evil which in retaliation of courtesies they are to be admonished of viz. they forget that the cause evermore alters the quality of the action nor was it ever thought by any of a found minde that justice should not be administred upon offenders left others by misapplication should thence take occasion to wrong the innocent and the honourable governours in new-england have learned and are perswaded that if they should sin by omitting duty for mans sake they should both dishonour god and grieve their brethren. to scare us the more with this they tell us how dr. stilling. fleet improved it to the same purpose against us all i shall say to this is we cannot confess guilty for the censure of those who neither knowing what we do nor weighing the difference of cases which they would make parallels rashly conclude against us we humbly conceive men that are not prejudiced will easily discern that suppressing with all gentleness and tenderness a dangerous error and of bad tendency such as anabaptism especially so circumstanced as in newengland it hath been and the enforcing of ceremonies in religion which are neither directly nor by any good consequence required in or by the word of god do differ toto coelo. for the concluding prayer we can heartily put it up to god and might have joyned with them in it too had they not added it as a cloak to the slander of their epistle. sect. now follows the narrative it self in which the first thing that us is indeed a brief account of their congregating or that of theirs in gathering a church where we have the moving the manner and the materials of it. the moving cause of it is brief and pithy it pleased god to their hearts and if this be indeed so then those that opposed in it and endeavoured to suppress them will be found fighters against god and to act in vain for the will of god shall be accomplished and no weapon formed against it shall prosper and this argument we shall finde them making use of page but who knows not that all hereticks pretend to the spirit and direction of god though it's certain that in so doing they take the name of god in vain and it's little less then blasphemy to bring god in to patronize their sinful actions for god doth not graciously move the hearts of any to irregular and unlawful actions and though men are very prone to entitle him to it yet he utterly disclaims it jam. 13 14. and it is certain that when men grow wanton and despise the ordinances god many times judicially gives them strong delusion to believe a lye 2 thess. 10 11. and that is none of the least to misjudge a seducing spirit to be the spirit of god. to follow an erring conscience which verily believes his error to be the truth is not to follow the direction of the spirit of god. if what god forbids conscience perswades this is not of gods approbation for so he should be against himself. it is a snare and a judgement to be under such a conscience so that they must pardon us if we suspect the moving cause. the persons thus moved are described from their former experience of his teaching such whom by his word and spirit he had instructed and taught in the way. thus one error begets another what have we to do with the anabaptists kuria d\\xf3xa do none but the orthodox bring this plea we expected he should have given us some rules by which we might have known it. it is a piece of arregancy for men to beg the principle or forcibly impose upon our belief that which is the very dispute and controversie between us whither it be an error or no and they tell us god taught them therefore it is no error true but if we reply it is an error therefore god taught them not where are we now are anabaptists only masters of rules and canons may not we as easily deny as they affirm without proof they entred into solemn covenant to walk in communion in the practice of all the holy appointments of christ and so became church of christ this alone will not make them a church of christ for it so then every combination of enthusiasts ranters may become churches of christ for they do pretend and promise each other in words as much as these or any other churches the world can do but there are synagogues of satan too in world. if they who are fit to be cast out of churches and are actually combine and covenant doth that make them a church they are men of holy and exact walking viz. in the and performance of the holy ordinances of christ according to institution if men were not proud and confident they would never impose their assertions upon us with an ipse dixit grant but an anabaptist that his opinion is true and he can easily prove that ours is false but if you question that he hath no more to say to you. it is certain they have exploded infant baptisme which hath been acknowledged by the body of the church christian in all ages not only for an institution but a principal institution of christ but if these deny it then we are mistaken. how like holy men they have walked will appear afterwards. he gives us the names of the men who laid this precious foundation and if they had been such men as had done this to begin right church order in new-england they ought not to be forgotten but had in honourable remembrance but if they were and i am afraid the great day will discover that they were the heads and ringleaders of a schisme and culpable cause of great troubles in the churches of christ in new-england they had better been forgotten. sect. and now we have a church gathered of such excellent materials and in so regular a way what reception is it they finde in new-england one would think that such a church and in such a place. should have been highly esteemed strenuously defended by the civil magistrate and imitated by all the churches who came into the wilderness on very purpose to serve god in his own way but unhappily missed of it till the anabaptists found it out but lo they meet the quite contrary they are assailed with troubles and afflictions and from whom certainly a vile generation but it must be born they not the first sufferers for the truth nor for falshood neither it alwayes befallen those whom god hath singled out from others to bear to the truth true the world ever persecuted the church have not the people of god also had their zeal to maintain the of god and counted it their duty to use means to suppress as upon what pretence soever sought to pervert them and if have proved his people with anabaptists as he is wont to do his with seducers who shall blame them that have shown their to god in endeavouring to stop their progress and thus the sufferings of these men will be a poor argument to prove them servants of christ though men may be sufferers yet they are not presently martyrs causa non passio facit martyrem. but these precious saints acted by the right spirit of the old confessors had counted the cost and therefore chearfully past these pikes and are now gone to rest and it is pity to disturb them only it might not be amiss to remember that the vilest hereticks and grossest blasphemers have resolutely and cheerfully at least sullenly and boastingly suffered as well as the people of god histories are pregnant with examples and therefore hitherto they have said nothing to convince any one of their orthodoxy and sincerity they may be right they may be out of the way for all this. sect. we have now done with the narrative handsomely contrived in one page the other fourteen are apologetical which they were put upon for three reasons. to emblazon the names of their dead founders and prevent the worlds being mistaken in them and truly first founders deserve a record and they should be unworthy successors if they did not canonize them though as things are circumstanced some wise men think they had done them a kindness if they had said nothing and to me i am sure for then i had been prevented this undesired task of publishing the follies of men after they are dead. the childe doth his father the best kindness to say nothing of him when by speaking he doth but revive his infamy. but i take it for a just judgement of god on that generation of men that by a fallacious narrative they should enforce us to make the world acquainted with the scandalous conversation of these beginners which had otherwise slept in the private records of those churches wherein they were acted. the very grievous scandals cast upon these beginners men if incorrigible deserve to have scandals cast upon and if we shall prove these such they must for ought i know the reproach of it and thank themselves. but yet there are two things wherein they are to be blamed lay scandal to them though just yet it is unjustly done. viz. the frame of spirit they do it with they are rugged truly this becomes not men who profess a spirit of meekness yet sometimes the gospel calls christians to withstand seducers the face to characterize some men in their proper colours and earnestly with them for the truth yea experience tells us such a rough thing as a new-england anabaptist is not to be handle ever tenderly the spirit which they have at all times discovered under the greatest disadvantages and god grant that they may never have more advantage over us easily tells us what they would have been if circumstanced as those whom they accuse. a wicked end and a good action may be spoiled by a bad design at bottom we have charged them on purpose to make them odious and make the world believe them a people not fit to live men wonderfully sagacious and extreamly charitable i dare say none of ours ever told them this was thier end why might they not have interpreted it zeal paul so interpreted his persecuting country-men. but suppose it be made appear that we have not endeavoured to render their persons odious but only their perverse doctrine and that we have used all meekness patience gentleness towards men in that capacity we took them to be in for any such passage of any of ours as judging them not fit to live i know not of it nor i believe do they nor do we patronize any such expression though since their book hath so many in it i know not why this may not go for one of their mistakes and now they appeal to god we accept it readily. sect. their great sufferings are of two forts. in estate and liberties of which we must not expect a particular account  are charitably to think it is because they are tender of our reputation but errorsly in generals a particular account might have been more satisfying. these things look directly upon our magistracy in vindication of them a word will suffice. two things take up this discourse the persecution and the success. the persecution is compendiously represented. some of were oftentimes brought before councils i suppose they allude to mat. 10. 17. to which let this be taken as a reply viz. that as the honoured magistrates here are christian so have they judged it their duty to maintain the ways of christ and strengthen them by civil laws which hath not only been the practice of reformers of old but the constant judgement of the church of christ ever since the apostles. if evil minded men will take this advantage to oppress the truth it is no more then may be done in all other cases  as it is thought no good plea to keep the scriptures from the laity lest they should learn to be hereticks so neither to deny the magistrate his due power on supposition that he may abuse it. on this principle our worthy rulers have made laws against many sects and intruders and among the rest the anabaptists. that in quelling the anabaptists they do not oppose the truth but suppress error they are fully perswaded and although they never pretended to a lordship over mens consciences yet they account the outward man is subject to them and if we must tarry till all men are agreed about what is truth before we oppose error we shall stay till there is no need . for the progress of our magistracy in the execution of these laws they have been so far from a violent eager or willing taking advantage against these men that notwithstanding their opprobrious speeches when they have been before them their scornful carriages and purposed indeavours to irritate them by insolent challenges they have alwayes proceeded slowly tenderly far on this side the law as those who sought not to ruine either their names liberties or estates. how often when fines have been laid upon them have they stopt the execution if any have been imprisoned it hath been but when dared to it and though once a sentence of banishment did pass upon two of their ring-leaders heady violent men yet then they neglected and scorned to take notice of it resolving to run utmost hazards neither was this improved as any advantage against them. nor is it to be wondred that our governours have been opposite in particular to these men since if they could get head among us they would certainly undermine the churches ruine order destroy piety and introduce prophaness. for the success of these endeavours god is pleased still to uphold them and they are by these means not weakened but strengthened and increased methinks i hear the jews crying we are delivered to do these abominations. let them but remember that many things are done by gods permissive providence when the doers have not his approbation nor is it an unfailing ground of sincerity that they have withstood such trials and are increased we know do what we can to restrain them evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse and many shall follow their pernicious wayes. nor is it to be wondred at that persons discontent with the yoke of christ in the churches or taking offence at particular administrations which might touch their own interest have so readily followed the faction of the anabaptists of which sort of men the most of their society and founders here have consisted. sect. their great sufferings in their name and it should seem there are many terms of reproach cast upon them pardon them then if they are very tender of their reputation. only they should have gone orderly to work first to have got a good name and then to have kept it by walking worthy of it. here we have a file of scandalous things laid to their charge they might have done well to have told us where and by whom that we might have compared them but i see we must do what we can and consider what is charged and how justly and whither they are wipe i away in their defense. these are no fewer then eight let us examine them. they are a schismatical company who have rent themselves from the churches of christ and received into their society such as have disorderly left the churches. ans. this charge in termes was never made against them by us and so part of their vindication is superfluous for we never said all of them rent from these churches some were strangers to us till their trubulency made them too well known and others were never joyned to other churches but had lived without communion. but that they are a society of schismaticks if schisme be an unjust renting from a church of christ we assert. three things they in words grant. that our churches are churches of christ page 14. that some of them were once members of them page that some of theirs did depart from these churches and joyn in this new combination page now to prove them hence a company of schismaticks observe that whosoever combine with and encourage schismaticks have fellowship with them in their sin. that thomas gold and thomas osborn the persons in dispute were schismaticks or did unjustly rend from the church where they were before members will appear by a true relation of matters of fact for this story of the narrative and truth are strangers whereof there is sufficient testimony to be found in the records of the church at charlstown whereof they were members and there are many faithful witnesses yet alive who were present at these transactions and can say if these things be not so which ought to outweigh the story of a prejudiced person who hath all by hearsay whose very business is to palliate and lick over matters to shape them to his own turn here for goodman gold let the reader consider these things and let the anabaptists disprove them if they can. that though he was first called to an account about withholding his childe from baptisme yet that was not the reason of his being admonished as the pamphlet asserts nor because he could not be convinced of error not yet did the church proceed to admonition till such time as he not only spake contemptuously and irreligiously of the emptiness  nullity of that ordinance but also used unbecoming gestures in the time of administration of which being asked the reason he before the congregation acknowledged they were to cast disresect upon it nor then neither till after much patience. now let anabaptists themselves judge whither there be not a vast difference between doubting about an ordinance and professedly vilifying of it by unhandsome words and carriages and whither they will bear with any member of theirs that will so contemn any of those things which are to them sacred and acknowledged as christs institutions. 2 that at his first admonition he was not sententially suspended but only desired for the preventing of the offence of some to abstain from coming to the other sacrament. that upon this thomas gold took up a trade of absenting himself from the meetings of the church to worship god on the sabbath which made a new offence. that the church in much tenderness waited upon him and after many provocations proceeded not to excommunication but tried with admonition upon admonition and that by the space of seven or eight years nor was he excommunicated till having left his own. he joyned to another society without the churches leave or once asking it and now also being twice sent for by the church their authority over him. that thomas gold did not leave the church at charlstown on the account of the anabaptists new church as is pretended but had many years before renounced his submission to that church. that he did while under admonition neglect publick worship and gather a private meeting on the sabbath to his house. that he did contrary to the judgement of anabaptists themselves wickedly slight the admonition of the church declaring that they had by it discharged him of all relation to them. for thomas osborne the churches proceedings with him were with the like patience as to thomas gold only it is to be observed that his first offence which this dissembling pamphlet finding it disadvantagious wilfully passeth over was this whereas it is one thing which church-members engage to upon admission to walk with the church in constant attendance upon publick worship he without notifying any offence did withdraw and separate frequenting those schismatick meetings at golds on the sabbath this was the offence where was the narrators conscience mean while nor did he when first dealt with pretend any dislke of infant baptisme but that the church gave no liberty to private brethren to prophesie that they limited the ministry to learned men and he did not find his own spirit free to come though afterwards he both of that and of their severity to the quakers though that church medled not with them but only to preach against their errors. in this practice he contumaciously persisted many years denying himself to be subject to that church or bound to assemble with them though he had solemnly given himself up to them in covenant slighting many admonitions and afterwards with thomas gold went off to and became a worthy pillar of an anabaptist church. and whereas he insists so upon a bitter spirit in the church against dissenters let seven years patience with serious endeavours in all tenderness to reclaim them speak whither it be not an audacious slander. and now reader judge are these a church of schismaticks or no sect. that we are scandalous in three respects. the foundation was laid with excommunicate persons. we called such to administer holy things who were justly for scandal cast out of churches. for receiving such into our society. ans.. this is indeed the charge from the just imputation all their tergiversations excuses suppressions of the truth and suggestions of falshood shall never acquit them. i find not that he denies the first proposition viz. that those who do such things adding the word justly to the first part of the charge are to be reputed scandalous. that they have so done remains to be proved. their foundation was laid with persons excommunicated and that for scandal for this it may be considered. thomas gold was not admonished for his opinion nor doth it appear that ever he should if he had carried humbly but for opprobrious words and carriages against an ordinance. which he himself had before professedly reverenced and highly esteemed and which he knew that church he walked with had still in the like esteem. and thomas osborne by relinquishing publick worship directly violated his covenant not so much as pretending at first any doubt about infant baptisme. they both of them despised the church continued to absent themselves laid false charges against them separated in a private meeting went off to the anabaptists without asking leave and so became supposed members of one before they were regularly discharged of their obligation to another church all which things are against the anabaptists own professed rules if they will stand to their confession. whereas he faith their not hearing the church was nothing else but their not coming when the church sent for them it is a foolish pretence their not hearing the church was their appearing and proving themselves impenitent and that after many treaties used with them many solemn admonitions laid upon them convictions sufficiently offered of sins against the light of their consciences and which it's certain they would have acknowledged had it not been for fear of being reconciled to the church whose excommunication they feared not but impudently desred. the truth is they were weary of their church relation and resolved to get rid of it and not knowing any regular way to obtain it they chose to sin rather then suffer and undergo a just excommunication that they might be by themselves presuming that they could blind the world with a vain pretense that they were ejected for no other reason but because they questioned the right of infant baptisme. hence thomas gold did particularly express before the church his desire to be excommunicated which yet they proceeded not to till by a first and second refusal to appear at the churches citing of them they proved themselves incorrigible. besides it is to be observed that these men having privately exercised their gifts in meetings with applause began to think themselves wronged that their light was put under a bushel and finding no remedy in our churches threw on a cloak of anabaptisme and so gained the thing they aimed at in a disguise. they called such to administer against all his winding to get clear of this only say thomas gold was thus imployed concerning whom too much hath been said except we had better to say. they have received such as have justly for moral evils been cast out of other churches adde and never given christian satisfaction. here he endeavours a salvo. the persons instanced are thomas foster and john farnham the former sometimes of the church as billerica. the other of the second gathered church in boston. he acknowledgeth they have received them but on just reasons or at worst not very irregularly. let the records of these churches be compared with this narrative and see if the anabaptists have not good skill in painting and putting a fair face on a foul matter. for thomas foster let it be observed. that he was not only a member of the church of billerica but of the foundation and at their gathering was full free and forward in owning infant baptisme to be as ordinance of christs institution and if he judged himself that notwithstanding to have been then a true christian he ought to have extended more charity then his after expressions shewed to the church still remaining of the same perswasion. that he first discovered his receding from that formerly received judgement by disorderly carriage at the time of administration of that ordinance and being reproved for it he confessed he had carried unbecoming any person in any christian assembly which gave satisfaction to the church. though when about three months after this he began and thence continued to leave the meeting at the celebration of baptism he was at a private church meeting given to understand that it grieved the brethren and that he had receded from his covenant and was advised solemnly and seriously to consider of it yet he was not as the narrator asserts laid under admonition or prohibited communion nor did the church ever do any such thing in private to any which he knew nor did they intend for this to have debarred him of communion. that after this he neglected the church assemblies and frequented the anabaptist meetings and was there rebaptized and being called by the church at a meeting at the pastors house to give an account of these proceedings though at first he dissembled yet at length acknowledged and justified his actions if false charges may be accounted a justification for he told them that they had laid him under sin whereas he thought he had not amiss but they had not so done judicially though they told him carriage was a grief to his brethren nor as i have said before intended it so far is the narration from speaking truth when it nothing but matter of conscience was or could be laid to his charge. that they denied him baptisme whereas they owned him for baptized and if he was not it was wickedness in him an unbaptized person to come to the lords table. that they yoked him with unbelievers which was because they extended church watch to a child or children of the church and yet for this he judged his separation lawful and produced for it 2 cor. 14 15 17. therein implicitly at least pronouncing the church a company of belialists and infidels. that they had presented him to the court the truth is one of the brethren of the church had made complaint of him to the grand-jury which occasioned his presentment judging his freemans oath engaged him so to do when other due means to reclaim him from his turbulent carriages had been used and this he makes the churches fault because they did not lay that brother under a censure for not daring to violate his oath and betray his fidelity to the civil authority. that they had dealt injuriously by one of his brethren in laying him under admonition in justification of which act there needs no account be given here only let any judge whither it be a just ground to separate from a church because i am not fully of their mind in every act of administration and also it seems a thing not warrantable for a private member of a church in pretence of selfvindication to vilifie and asperse a church of christ if this be humility what is pride but yet the church still continued to labour his conviction and when they could not obtain it after much patience they called him forth in publick charged him with offensive departing and rending away from the church denying himself a subject of discipline and vilifying the church by charges he observing on ready to write his answer refused to speak any thing unless he were forbidden and not obteining it essayed to depart yea though required by the officer to stay and hear the church he wilfully withdrew on the following sabbath he was for these carriages admonished and debarred communion and not till then and after some patience used being called forth again to see if it repented him he remained obstinate and was therefore excommunicated and now compare notes and see what will become of john russel's consectaries as for his retaining the respect of a very godly man where he is known which is so boasted of it must be only among men void of reason for though we will not say but he may have the root in him yet he hath blasted profession by wicked wayes impenitently persisted in and thereby wounded such mens charity who judge as they ought of the tree by the fruit. sect. relating to john farnum we have him confessing guilty in some things acknowledging a defect but would not have it thought wilful nor such as any church in their imperfection may not easily fall into well they can make great faults little and small ones none at all. in sober earnest we may say of this act of theirs about farnum that if in nothing else they had been guilty yet that is enough to render them low in the hearts of any good men and a shame to anabaptists themselves. a little in so dirty a matter is enough to be said therefore they say when he walked in fellowship with the church he was in reputation among them for a very godly man. they should have left the word very out though in charity they had hopes he might have the root of the matter in him yet he was never judged eminent for his piety it was long ere he could obtain admission into the church at dorchester  some discerning christians ever suspected him to be john farnum such an one as he after proved. that he was deputed by them for a deacon and yet neither the present teacher nor any that have been added to the church these twenty years either deputed or thought him fit for that office and whereas there is but one surviving of the founders of that church he professeth there is never a syllable of truth in that report. that the churches was upon account of his opinion. the rugged spirit in these men against was the his withdrawing. other things were gathered to this having a face of scandal. a true survey of the churches proceedings will shew the vanity of these assertions for the church did not so much as deal with him till he had wholly withdrawn communion from them refusing so much as to hear the word preached with them for many months no nor so much as declared themselves offended with him. what now is this rugged spirit when he alledged his opinion the teacher of the church though possibly some may think he did more than the rule required declared to him that if he were so weak as not to think it lawful to see a child baptized his withdrawing when that ordinance was administered should not be imputed as an offence how is it then that his judgement was the principal thing in that process his offence for which he was dealt with was many moral evils and so a complicate offence breaking forth at once viz. renouncing communion with the church contrary to heb. 10. 24. holding familiarity with excommunicate persons contrary to math. 18 17. thess. 6 14. slanders against several holy and worthy men now with christ. that having been often reproved for these things he still persisted. when the elders reproved him for these slanders he replied that they might be offended at a thousand things he cared not and that there was never an elder in newengland was willing any should read the scripture but themselves after this he was called before the church tenderly dealt with and those scripture rules which he had transgressed were applied to his conscience but in vain. at the third church meeting on his account octob. 16. 1665. the pastor mr. mayo told him it wos expected that after so much patience he should manifest repentance. his reply was that he desired none of their patience he was humbled for his sins. the teacher mr. mather saying to him we must see it by the fruits he retorted you see it you shall never see it some brethren told him his speeches and carriage were very sinful they had never seen the like be replied i did not come hither to be and at by every one and so he turned his back to depart the pastor wished him to stay and hear what further they had to say and seeing him still proceed charged him in the name of the church and of christ to stay he rejoyned christ to me i am not out that can how and stoop exit. the same day he told some of the brethren that he wished the church would excommunicate him and then he should be of a better society. on all these accounts was he laid under admonition. two months after which being called before the church he in words confest the evil of some of the particulars but was observed at the same time to turn about and laugh where then was his repentance the church this notwithstanding waited divers months longer till he went on to that height of impiety and prophaneness that one of the teaching officers setting before the church the rule concerning excommunication farnum makes a leg to him in the assembly in way of derision and declared that except the church would yield to four things he would have no communion with them viz. they must set up the ordinance of . promise to baptize no more infants. all be baptized rebaptized themselves. put away their present and still continuing teacher from his office. upon these things the church concluded upon his censure only allowing him another months patience after which no repentance appearing they proceeded. now judge whither these things have no more than a face of scandal and that too only as they are taken and construed. whither their admission of him were not more than a meer defect in those who so admitted him yea a meer scandal stinking in the nothrils of moral men. whither if it were but a defect it were not a wilful one since they either had or might have had an account of the churches proceedings with him and ought to have inquired after the true cause of his excommunication before they received him. well it was but a little fault and a little amendment was enough and what was that when clamors were revived and renewed and then to speak of open and notorious wickedness if it be approved by a society of an baptists is clamour. but it's well a clamour roused them whom serious warnings and informations could not. and now the church in good time are dissatisfied and determine to make search but they knew before that he was excommunicated only because he was an anabaptist they concluded it was for his opinion we see what harm too much credulity doth men. now they send messengers procure a copy of proceedings and are convinced better late then never suspend him bring him to give them satisfaction advise him to satisfie the church he had offended patcht cobling work a good shoe-maker would have scorn'd it. who appointed the anabaptist church to be a court of to judge cases for and receive satisfaction on the account of church in respect of any of their members ex this teacheth us what lordly men they would be had they advantage. but he did apply himself to that church and all were well satisfied but one how did goodman russel know this suppose all but one remained dissatisfied nay what if not so much as one was well satisfied where are we then except he know them better then they know themselves both the elder and brethren utterly deny the truth this passage it is true indeed he did once and again in acknowledge that the church had exercised patience towards him and that he had been guilty of sin and great evil both in word and action and orally before the church he confessed he had done very wickedly and was ashamed of himself the church then had done well. but why is he not then upon this restored alas this he sought not but the very next day declared that if he should return into communion with that church it would be the greatest sin that ever he had been guilty of in his life which made the brethren suspect his confession to be insyncere and yet this satisfies the anabaptists they still continue to hold communion with a vile person justly cast out not seeing to be restored and therefore by the will of christ to be counted and carried to as an heathen and a publican. sect. that we are disorderly and walk disorderly. for all his excuse and abuse of scripture in it there needs no more but to consider whither it be not to walk disorderly to receive into their communion persons that are under church dealing for moral evils yea excommunicate impenitents and not to withdraw from them after they have confessed they missed it in so doing. if this be not disorder to set up a church for a sanctuary or city of refuge for scandalous men who scorning to submit to the discipline of christ presently take up anabaptisme and know where to be made welcome we may then enquire whither there be any such thing as disorder. sect. we are disturbers of the publick pace that this hath been charged upon them i find not but that they have made disturbance among us is true what else have been the of some now theirs when of other churches with the courses they have taken to make parties what their many complaints into england and misrepresentations of us to render us as obnoxious as might be and what this narrative sect. that we are under miners of the churches and is not this true neither alas that in all things we should so mistake but this we mean that such of these men as sometimes stood in relation to other churches fought to draw others away with them witness thomas gol's private meeting in his own house for many years where living two miles distant from the publick place of worship their neighbours i speak things known were drawn in and there were the churches and ministers scoffed at and means used to alienate mens hearts and not only so but they have published to the world that infant baptisme is a nullity that we are churches of unbaptized men and women and have unbaptized officers by these pleas seeking to draw men off and if this be their reduction it is in vain distinguished from destruction and is properly seduction. adde to this their readiness to receive any discontented persons so that if any be under offence in any of our churches though he be never so vile let him but turn anabaptist they will take up his case if he can satisfie them and we may think a little will do let his own seek it where they can getis not this undermining nay have they not by that unjust and false reports done more hurt to the churches of christ in new-england than all their enemies in the world besides sect. we neglect publick worship on the lords day what he brings are for justification is to us a confessing guilty that is it we mean and therefore what we say is not utterly untrue only the reasons give for their separation are misrepresented. whereas they mould not admit any of them to communion with us they know our churches have received some that were scrupulous about baptisme who were willing to carry inoffensively that we haveused such as were rebaptized among these excommunicate ana is true by viz. except they would acknowledge repent of that act because we judge it scandalous. and the world we have been shut out of our publick house and nailed up and we forced to meet without in the open air on a old day he seems to have forfeited all honestly so to relate it is true the civil authority here have by a prohibited any from erecting any publick meeting house the consent of the freemen of the town where they live first orderly had and obtained at a publick meeting assembled for that end and license of the county court without such a law many hopeful plantations would have come to nothing. and it equally concerned all others with anabaptists and yet these men neglecting this law undertake such a business. report of this is made to the civil magistrate who enquired into it and these fallaciously pretend it might be for a warehouse or a brew-house that they still proceed till it become a meeting house and is met in on the lords dayes now are they again called before the council justly reproved for slighting the law and for dissimulation and lovingly desired to be content to meet in private as before till the general court near approaching might hear and determine this matter. they refusing to promise so to do. order was given to nail up their doors whereupon the anabaptists sullenly meet in the open air on a cold day though a large house and their usual place of meeting stood just by that they might make matter to frame a scandalous clamour out of yet were the doors soon broken open again and they there publickly meet before the court. now only desire to be satisfied who gave these men leave to trample all authority under foot and live as men that are lawless sect. that we are idolaters for this they quote the late synod-book but there is no such word there we have not been afraid to charge them with the breach of the second commandment. every declining from the rules of worship omission or alteration of divine institutions without immediate warrant from the law giver is against that command. sect. we are charged to be enemies of civil government. i find no such charge the first germane anabaptists were so we hope these though they have shown too much contempt of authority are not so far gone. but for his so gloriouslyblazoning their service in the late wars it is neither to the purpose nor of much moment. that they did joyn against the common enemy is true swanzy a place chiefly consisting of anabaptists and where they had a church was the place where the enemy made the first onset which church being one of two was as much removed as our four of above forty they so upbraid us with page 15. besides would fight rather than have his throat cut it was not for religion nor civil government but for lives and estates. for captain turner we have not abridged him ought of his due acknowledgement in what hath been published. but for his acts at connecticut falls they are hyperbolically discribed for there was another captain and his company joyned with him in that undertaking a man of appoved valour and conduct which at that time he discoverprudent drawing off his men. captain turner was at that time by sickness disabled from doing much. 3 god saw meet to obscure the victory by the affrighted and disorderly retreat of our men the slaughter of many and death of captain turner. nor did the indians receive the greatest blow at that time nor is it the anabaptists true but vain glory to set such an encomium upon their own deeds. sect. we have dismissed the charge now comes a strong argument of their orthodoxy a witness from heaven viz. their happy preservation in the of the small pox let it be remembred that one of their perswasion did of it at woborn where john russel lived and should have observed it and many of their children. but be it so their society is small and scattered from dan to beersheba. and who knows but god might spare them in judgement to harden them these things are too high for us only when god comes to chasten his people those that are not chastened may ask whither they are no bastards. sect. and now he had done had not a book of mr. mather's come out to which he hath a few words to say and a few he thinks are enough to confute so weak and silly a piece it is titled the divine right of infant baptisme ans. sooner said then proved. excellently refuted but he hath a word more in general and one or two in particular to say to it. in general any sober unbyassed christian may be satisfied that the main or one main design of it is to render all that are nicknamed anabaptists as odious as he could i am sorry for it that so good a look should have so bad a design but he is no unbyassed christian who asserts it and it is strange that that worthy man whose charity hath been so large to such men as is well known should be thus guilty and if he be truly it is very unhappy. but divers that have the book cannot spy it i fear it is a suspicious censorious slander. for his arguments it's answered they are no new ones and i like them the better verissimum est antiquissimum had he brought novel pleas i had suspected him as i do for that reason the anabaptists nay he tells us page he intends old arguments and no other. but what then they must have no new answer being sufficiently confuted already. i am glad of that he saves me some labour by it. he blames him not for disputing for what he believes nor i neither but think he deserves commendation and god hath blessed it to the reclaiming of several that way inclined and settling many more in the truth. but why should mr. mather wickedly injure holy men by arguing an opinion must needs he bad because the professors of it have miscarried. but mr. mather hath expresly declared against any such conclusion. page 25. this is the sum of his argument. that opinion which hath been attended with signal judgements on the first and chief assertors of it and generality of those that have especially at first embraced it is to be suspected as erroneous. and is it any harm for men to suspect themselves when god seems to frown on them do not the anabaptists allow this argument and therefore plead that god kept and increased them under persecution page 2 and wonderfully preserved them in times of sickness page 12. which they desire may be observed though this is of little weight because these are not the first nor the chief. and do not the generality of the orthodox improve this argument against hereticks doth not john russel use it against us page 15. what besel corinthus manicheus arius dr. beards theater of gods judgements mr. clarks examples and others may speak for this. nay was it not thus with korah with ananias and saphira and for gods judicially leaving them to scandalous evils. see mat. 15 16. tim. 13. and what befel the first anabaptists see sleidan's commentaries and other authors of great note quoted by mr. mather. sect. but there is a thing or two in particular which he pass they touch him so near. mr mather chargeth them with the sin of jeroboam but they are not concerned in or with it. the text alluded to is i kings 12.3 the original is jeroboam made priests of the extremities of the people both ends comprehend the whole see in ezek. 33. it was sin that any that would might under him be made priest fit or unfit. the belgick and others read it of both ends of the people. if a fit man would accept it so if not to the other end and take one unfit. the anabaptists would have a learned man if they could get one of their mind if not john russel the shoemaker. the learned zepperus. depolit. eccl. 186. lamenting the low and miserable estate of religion gives this for one reason of it they make ministres de populist sartoribus sutoribus idiotis he doth not think the spirit is locked up in the narrow limits of colledge learning. nor we neither nor yet ministerial gifts to be ordinarily acquired in a shoemakers shop. we believe men are to be instructed and endeavours used and that there are schools of the prophets to that end or there may be private means used. we believe a learned man may prove  tious and so not fit to improved in that work. we believe every true christian receives the spirit in his measure but that he therefore is fit to teach and instruct a congregation is an enthusiastical notion. truly if goodman russel was a fit man for a minister we have but fooled our selves in building colledges and instructing our children in learning. frange leves calamos  scinde thalia sebellos si dare sutori calceus ista potest. mart. we have enough of his last to people new-england with prophets. sect. one thing more and he will dismiss us mr. mather chargeth them with a pernicious principle in their confession of faith viz. that believers baptized are visible christians and fit matter for a visible church. how may the altering of a word or two change the sence the words of their confession are believers being baptized are visible saints and true matter of a visible church. hence if the anabaptists would give leave to draw consequences but then they would never have done with us and that is the reason they cannot receive our arguments for infant baptisme because they are nothing but a few consequences and that is nothing to the purpose a man might argue that believers being unbaptized are not visible saints  we know they acknowledge none baptized but themselves and that will bring in another consequence that there are no visible saints but anabaptists but suppose a man cannot reach them a blow with a consequence let them yet say is baptisme administred to persons within the visible church or without it besides they say baptized persons are true matter of a visible church were only sprinkled in their infancy were never baptized not this undermine the foundation of all the churches in the but theirs and what more pernicious they had even as good with edom' sons raze it raze it to the foundation. and now he cannot chuse but burst out into a lamentation over such a spirit but thus it will be in the world that the joy of some will be made the grief of others the triumph of will be the mourning of error i pray god this cause of the may be continued by the constant supply men zealous against errors. sect. for a conclusion the narrator turns prophet  gets up to the top of mount ebal and there curses the people of god or these churches in new-england and what is it so stirs his splene why they have born their witness faithfully against anabaptists errors and scandals and detected the sin of those men who after they have for lyes' slanders covenant breaking despising gods ministers and slighting the admonitions of their respective churches been in christs name delivered up to satan have joyned themselves in erecting and establishing in anti-temple and like the samaritans of old become a mount gerizzim a den and receptacle for every mal-content and scandalous person that cannot submit to the discipline of christ in his churches to repair unto. and now for this they are compared to those damnable hypocrites mentioned mat. 24. 49. and threatned with no less then eternal desolation. we see what men may come to in time with falshoods and end with cursings. but causeless curses shall not come nor need these churches regard if they keep faithful to their god though anabaptists anathematize them. \""
